Internet-Draft       BCP 47 Unicode Locale Extension       November 2009


1.  Introduction

   [BCP47] provides extensions identified by a single-character subtag
   for "the generation of identifiers that contain a language component
   and are compatible with applications that understand language tags".
   This document defines such an extension, using the letter 'u', to
   specify Unicode language/locale identifiers.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  BCP47 Required Information

   Language tags, as defined by [BCP47], are useful for identifying the
   language of content.  They are also used as locale identifiers (or
   can be mapped to locales) in many operating environments and APIs.
   However, most such locale identifiers also provide additional
   "tailorings" or options for specific values within a language,
   culture, or other regional variation.  This extension provides a
   mechanism for using these additional tailorings within language tags
   for general interchange.

   The maintaining authority for this extension's registry is the
   Unicode Consortium.  Unicode defines common locale data and
   identifiers for this data:

   | URL Location  | cldr.unicode.org                                  |
   | Specification | Unicode Technical Standard #35 Unicode Locale     |
   |               | Data Markup Language (LDML),                      |
   |               | http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/                  |
   | Section       | Section 3.2 BCP 47 Tag Conversion                 |
   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

   The specification of extension subtags is provided by Unicode
   Technical Standard #35 Unicode Locale Data Markup Language, Section
   3.2 BCP 47 Tag Conversion [LDML].  [LDML] defines the formation of
   subtags which follow the language tag ABNF and other rules for the

   formation of language tags and subtags as defined in [BCP47].  In
   particular, it specifies that subtags are restricted to the ASCII
   letters and digits, that case is not significant, and that subtags
   MUST NOT exceed eight characters in length.

   [LDML] specifies a canonical representation.  LDML is available over
   the Internet and at no cost, and is available via a royalty-free
   license at http://unicode.org/copyright.html.  LDML is versioned, and
   each version of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable.  Extension
   subtags, once defined by LDML, are never retracted or change in
   meaning in a substantial way.  LDML will include in a separate
   section the registration form in Section 2.2.

2.1.  Summary

   [LDML] defines the subtags within the 'u' extension as a series of
   key-value pairs.  Each key has a length of two characters, and each
   value has a length of three or more characters.  Each key is followed
   by zero or one value.  Case is not significant.  The canonical case
   is lowercase; the canonical order of the keys is alphabetical.

   The exact keys and values available, and their meanings, are defined
   in TODO ldml-registry TODO [ldml-registry].

2.2.  Registration Form

   Per [RFC5646], Section 3.7:
   %%
   Identifier: u
   Description: Unicode Locale
   Comments: Subtags for the identification of language and cultural
       variations. Used to set behavior in locale APIs.

   Thanks to John Emmons and the rest of the Unicode CLDR Technical
   Committee for their work in developing the BCP 47 subtags for LDML.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document will require IANA to insert the record in Section 2.2
   into the Language Extensions Registry, according to Section 3.7.
   Extensions and the Extensions Registry of "Tags for Identifying
   Languages" in BCP 47.  There might be occasional maintenance of this
   record.  This document does not require IANA to create or maintain a
   new registry or otherwise impact IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for this extension are the same as those
   for [RFC5646] (or its successors).  See Section 6.  Security
   Considerations of [RFC5646].
