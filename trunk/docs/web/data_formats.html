          <h1 align="center">CLDR Data Formats</h1>
          <p>This document provides basic information about data formats for fields in the Common 
          Locale Data Repository. It is intended to clarify the meaning of some of the data in the 
          CLDR for localizers and other people reading the CLDR comparison charts. The references 
          given below are to the LDML specification.</p>
          <h2><a name="General">General</a></h2>
          <p>The locale data should be in the customary form for the target language, in the form 
          that is in most common usage. For example, for the territory name in English one would use 
          &quot;Switzerland&quot; instead of &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot;, and use &quot;United Kingdom&quot; instead of &quot;The 
          United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
          <p>As with all of the CLDR data, the language locale should contain the most broadly used 
          data for that language; specific region locales will <i>only</i> contain data where they 
          need to override individual items, when the inherited language locale data would not be 
          customary in that region.</p>
          <p>The formats are described in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/">UTS 
          #35: LDML</a> specification; in addition, there is a link at the top of the page to the
          <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">ICU locale explorer</a>, where the 
          results of different formats can be viewed. Note that some fields are expected to be in 
          English, since they indicate internal IDs and <i>not</i> translated text, such as the 
          layout orientation, which has the value &quot;top-to-bottom&quot;.</p>
          <p><b>Note: </b>If you ever need to convert text from hex format (\uXXXX) to real 
          characters or back, you can do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>go to the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/tr">ICU Transform Demo</a></li>
            <li>set <i>Compound 1</i> to <u>NFC</u>, and <i>Compound 2</i> to <u>[:^ascii:] hex</u></li>
            <li>paste what you want to convert into <i>Input</i>, and click <i>Transform</i>.</li>
            <li>this will also give the NFC form of the text, which is preferred.</li>

          <h2><a name="Collation">Collation</a> (Sorting Sequence)</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The exact collation sequence for a given language may be difficult to determine. The 
            base ordering of characters can be fairly straightforward, but there are quite a few 
            other complications involved. For more information, see
            <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Introduction">UTS #10: Unicode Collation 
            Algorithm</a> (UCA).</p>
            <p>For readability, the rules are presented here in Java/ICU rule format, rather than 
            XML; for the same reason, we prefer the bug reports to also use that format, even though 
            the end result will be in XML. For more information, see
            <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Customization.html">ICU 
            Collation Customization</a>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Comparison Charts</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In the comparison charts, rules are gathered programmatically; gathering the data for 
            the rules is complicated by a number of factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Different data sources use a different &quot;base&quot; for tailoring (the Common rules use 
              the UCA as a base).</li>
              <li>Sometimes special features are handled programmatically, such as having an SHADDA 
              mark apply to all Unicode characters instead of just Arabic letters.</li>
              <li>Sometimes characters out of the repertoire are simply ignored, thus having a<font size="3">ż 
              &lt; ab, since ż (z with over-dot) is ignored.</font></li>
              <li><font size="3">Sometimes orderings from other platforms will not abide by the UCA 
              well-formedness criteria, so there may be cases where for characters X and Y:</font>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="3">X &lt; Y</font></li>
                <li><font size="3">XY and YX are not contractions</font></li>
                <li><font size="3">but XY = YX.</font></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Pitfalls</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>There are a number of pitfalls with collation, so be careful. In some cases, such as 
            Hungarian or Japanese, the rules can be fairly complicated (of course, reflecting that 
            the sorting sequence for those languages is complicated).</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Only tailor expected data. </b>We focus on the required collation sequence for 
              a given language with normal data. So we don&#39;t include full-width characters for a 
              European collation sequence, such as
              <ul>
                <li>... CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; ＣＳＣＳ ...</li>
                <li>...&nbsp; CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; \uFF23\uFF33\uFF23\uFF33 ... (equivalently)</li>

              <li><b>Tailor trailing contractions. </b>If a sequence of characters is treated as a 
              unit for collation, it should be entered as a contraction.
              <p>&amp; c &lt; ch</p>
              <p>One might think that sequence like &quot;dz&quot; doesn&#39;t require that, since it would always 
              come after &quot;d&quot; followed by any other letter; it is a &quot;trailing contraction&quot;. But in 
              unusual cases, that wouldn&#39;t be true; if &quot;dz&quot; is a unit sorted as if it were a 
              distinct letter after &quot;d&quot;, one should get the ordering &quot;d<font size="3">α&quot; &lt; &quot;dz&quot;. 
              This will only happen if &quot;dz&quot; is a contraction, such as</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">&amp; d &lt; dz</font></li>
              <li><b>Watch out for Expansions.</b> If you have a rule like &amp;cs &lt; d, and &quot;cs&quot; has not 
              occurred in a previous rule as a contraction, then this is automatically considered to 
              be the same as &amp;c &lt; d / s; that is, the d <i>expands</i> as if it were a &quot;cs&quot; 
              (actually, primary greater than a &quot;cs&quot;, since we wrote &quot;&lt;&quot;). This expansion takes 
              effect until the next primary difference.
              <p>So suppose that &quot;ccs&quot; is to behave as if it were &quot;cscs&quot;, and take case differences 
              into account. You might try to do this with the rules on the left:</p>
              <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
                <tr>
                  <th width="50%" align="left">Rules (Wrong)</th>
                  <th width="50%" align="left">Actual Effect</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>
                  &amp; cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs<br>
                  &lt;&lt;&lt; Cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs<br>
                  &lt;&lt;&lt; CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; CCS</td>
                  <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>
                  &amp; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs / cs<br>
                  &lt;&lt;&lt; Cscs&nbsp; / cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs&nbsp; / cs<br>

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>But since the <u>CSCS</u> has not been made a contraction in previous rules, this 
              produces an automatic expansion, one that continues through the entire sequence of 
              non-primary differences, as shown on the right. This is <i>not</i> what is wanted: 
              each item acts like it expands compared to the previous item. So CCS, for example, 
              will act like it expands to CSCScs!</p>
              <p>What you actually want is the following:</p>
              <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
                <tr>
                  <th width="50%" align="left">Rules (Right)</th>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>In short, when you have expansions, it is always safer and clearer to express them 
              with separate resets. There are only a few exceptions to this, notably when CJK 
              characters are interleaved with Hangul Syllables.</li>
              <li><b>Don&#39;t tailor what you don&#39;t have to. </b>Example: Maltese was sorting character 
              sequences <i>before</i> a base character using the following style:
              <p>&amp; B<br>
              &lt; ċ<br>
              &lt;&lt;&lt;Ċ<br>
              &lt; c<br>
              &lt;&lt;&lt;C</p>
              <p>This works, but is sub-optimal for two reasons.
              <ol>
                <li>it tailors c/C when it doesn&#39;t need to be; any extra tailoring generally makes 
                for longer sort keys.</li>
                <li>by tailoring c/C, it puts other those things that are after b/B after c/C 
                instead. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/">
                http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/</a>&nbsp; for examples.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The correct rules should be:</p>
              <p>&amp; [before 1] c &lt; ċ &lt;&lt;&lt; Ċ</p>
              <p>This finds the highest primary (that&#39;s what the 1 is for) character less than c, 
              and uses that as the reset point. For Maltese, the same technique needs to be used for 
              ġ and ż.</li>

            <p>The exemplar character set contains the commonly used letters for a given modern form

          <h2><a name="Display_Names">Display Names</a>: Languages, Scripts, Territories, 
          Currencies, Time Zones</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>These items are perhaps the simplest to translate. The type values that can be used 
            for each are found in Appendix K: <span>
            <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#valid_attribute_values">Valid Attribute 
            Values</a></span></p>
            <p>The typical behavior if any particular translation is not available is to display the 
            corresponding code, such as an ISO or RFC 3166 code. Thus if there is no localization of 
            FR (France), then the string &quot;FR&quot; will appear.</p>
            <p>The names must, however, be unique within a given category: thus one cannot use the 
            same translated name for the following two:<br>
&nbsp; <i>&lt;territory type=&quot;CD&quot;&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/territory&gt;</i><br>
            <i>&nbsp; &lt;territory type=&quot;CG&quot;&gt;Congo&lt;/territory&gt;</i></p>
            <p>Whatever is most typically used to distinguish these in the target language can be 
            used, for example, one could have the translated equivalents of the following:<br>
            <br>
            <i>&nbsp; &lt;territory type=&quot;CD&quot;&gt;Congo (Kinshasa)&lt;/territory&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;territory type=&quot;CG&quot;&gt;Congo (Brazzaville)&lt;/territory&gt;</i></p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p><i>&nbsp; &lt;territory type=&quot;CD&quot;&gt;Congo (formerly Zaire)&lt;/territory&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;territory type=&quot;CG&quot;&gt;Congo&lt;/territory&gt;<br>
            </i><br>
            Typically one should only use such parenthesized additions if the name would either not 
            be unique or not be recognizable to a large group of people. Only if the name would not 
            be recognizable to a large number of people should there be an alternative name.</p>
            <p>For a list of the kinds of IDs that can be localized, see the
            <a href="diff/main/en_US.html">English-US locale data</a>, which has all territories, 
            languages, and scripts that can be translated. It does not contain all currencies and 
            timezones.</p>
            <p>Because these lists are long, it may be more difficult to collect all the data at 
            once. If that is the case, we suggest first providing translations of at least the 
            elements that are most familiar to people with the target language. This might be, for 
            example, the territories, languages, scripts, and (modern) currencies for:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Territories having the target language as an official language</li>
              <li>G7 + BRIC territories: US, Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy; Brazil, 
              Russia, India, China</li>
              <li>Territories adjacent to the territories in #1</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Beyond that, one should use frequency of usage in the target language as a guide: it 
            is clearly more important to have an accurate name for &quot;Russian&quot; or &quot;Arabic&quot; than it is 
            to have an accurate name for &quot;Middle Irish&quot;.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Languages</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The language codes are based on <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">
            ISO-639</a>. The translations for the names of the other languages in the current given 
            language should be cased according to how the language name would appear in the middle 
            of a sentence or in a list. If the user of this data is going to use the name at the 
            beginning of a sentence, the developer (not the translator) will title case the word. 
            For example, English will translate fr to be &quot;French&quot;, but Spanish will translate fr to 
            be &quot;francés&quot;.</p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>In CLDR 1.1, the time periods are included in the English translations 
            of languages (from the ISO names), such as the following:</p>
            <p><i>&nbsp; &lt;language type=&quot;gmh&quot;&gt;German, Middle High (ca.1050-1500)&lt;/language&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;language type=&quot;goh&quot;&gt;German, Old High (ca.750-1050)&lt;/language&gt;</i></p>
            <p>We will probably be converting those to XML comments, so it is not recommended to 
            keep those parentheticals in the translation unless there is no good term for describing 
            the differences between codes such as gmh and goh in the target language.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Scripts</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The script codes are based on <a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/">
            ISO-15924</a>. A script is the set of characters used to display a language. For 
            example, English is written with the Latin script, and the ISO-15924 code for Latin is 
            &quot;Latn&quot;.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Some language can be written in more than one script. For example, the Serbian 
            language can be written in the Latin or Cyrillic scripts, and Uzbek can be written with 
            Cyrillic, Latin or Arabic scripts.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Territories</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The region codes are based on
            <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/">ISO-3166</a>. These region 
            codes include countries, territories and some other places of interest around the world.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Currencies</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The currency codes are based on
            <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical+Information/Publications/_Publications/tig90.xalter">
            ISO-4217</a>. A similar list can be found

            here</a>. There are two things can be translated here. One part is the display currency 
            symbol (e.g. the $ for the US dollar), and the other part is the display name (e.g. the 
            &quot;US Dollar&quot; for $). The ISO-4217 code is used as the key for these translations.</p>

          <h3>Time Zones</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A time zone uses the Olson IDs, such as America/Los Angeles. These IDs provide not 
            only the information as to the offset from GMT (UTC), but also the daylight savings 
            information. Thus, for example, America/Phoenix is distinct from America/Denver because 
            they have different daylight savings time behavior. There are many cases where there is 
            no modern difference between two IDs; they are only distinguished in the past. For 
            example, America/Chicago and America/Indianapolis are currently the same, but differed 
            in the past.</p>
            <p>Most territories do not span multiple time zones, and may not have localized names 
            for particular time zones. In that case, probably the best localizations are something 
            of a form like &quot;New York Time&quot;.</p>
            <p>The fields are long and short (abbreviated) versions of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>generic time zone name, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Time</span></li>
              <li>summer/daylight savings time, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Standard Time</span></li>

          <h2 align="left"><a name="Numbers">Numbers</a></h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>There are different formats for different types of numbers. For example, here are 
            some patterns (using the unlocalized symbols) with the corresponding text. While the 
            format is localized, the <i>characters to specify the format pattern</i> are not 
            localized. That is, the decimal point always is represented by a &quot;.&quot;, and the grouping 
            separator (thousands, etc.) is always represented by a &quot;,&quot;.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a> resource affects how these patterns 
            are interpreted in a localized context. Here are some examples, based on the French 
            locale. The &quot;.&quot; shows where the decimal point should go. The &quot;,&quot; shows where the 
            thousands separator should go. A &quot;0&quot; indicates zero-padding: if the number is too short, 
            a zero (in the locale&#39;s numeric set) will go there. A &quot;#&quot; indicates no padding: if the 
            number is too short, nothing goes there. A &quot;¤&quot; shows where the currency sign will go. 
            The following illustrates the effects of different patterns for the French locale, with 
            the number &quot;1234.567&quot;</p>

            <p>Even for territories where the customary date format only has a 24 hour format, both 
            the am and pm localized strings must be present and must be distinct from one another. 
            Note that as long as the 24 hour format is used, these strings will normally never be 
            used, but for testing and unusual circumstances they must be present.</p>

          <h3>Eras</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>There are only two values for an era in a Gregorian calendar, &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;. These 
            values can be translated into other languages, like &quot;a.C.&quot; and and &quot;d.C.&quot; for Spanish, 
            but there are no other eras in the Gregorian calendar. Other calendars have a different 
            numbers of eras. Care should be taken when translating the era names for a specific 
            calendar.</p>

          <h3>Week of Year</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Values calculated for the Week of Year field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a year is 
            the first week of that year that contains at least the minimum days in a week days. 
            Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year are numbered 
            sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed). For example, January 1, 1998 was a 
            Thursday. If the first day of the week is MONDAY and the minimum days in a week is 4 
            (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many national standards), then week 1 of 
            1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. However, if the first day 
            of the week is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and ends on 
            January 10, 1998. The first three days of 1998 are then part of week 53 of 1997.</p>
            <p>Values are similarly calculated for the Week of Month.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>In the comparison charts, the ordering of characters for BIDI languages is up to the 
            browser. The ordering may differ from the typical ordering in context, so may be helpful 
            to copy the text from the charts and paste into typical environments to ensure that the 
            ordering is correct. This is especially the case for date, time and number formats.</p>

            <p><span>The data in the locale repository should contain the most appropriate choice of 
            characters for the representation of the text. It may thus include Unicode characters 
            that are not included in a given legacy character set. In particular, the data may 
            contain curly quotes and apostrophes (such as in “can’t”), and similar characters such 
            as the letter modifiers in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi.</span></p>
            <p><span>These characters provide more distinctions than are available with the generic 
            ASCII repertoire. They may be “downcast” to the best available characters when the data 
            is imported into systems with a more limited repertoire of supported characters.</span></p>
