					<h1>Unicode CLDR Technical Committee Process</h1>
					<h2><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
					<p>This document describes the Unicode CLDR Technical Committee, and its process for data collection, resolution, public feedback and release. The process 
					is designed to be light-weight: in particular, the meetings are frequent, short, and informal. Most of the work is by email or phone, with a 
					database recording requested changes in data.</p>
					<p>When gathering data for a region and language, it is important to have multiple sources for that data to produce the most widely acceptable 
					data. Initial versions of data were based on the best available sources, but CLDR data will be modified and improved, in successive versions, 
					by more input from the contributors inside and outside of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that CLDR is a Repository, not a Registration. That is, contributors should not expect that their contributions will 
					simply be adopted into the repository; instead, it will be vetted against the best available information.</p>
					<p>All inputs are open, and gathered via the <a href="survey_tool.html">CLDR Survey Tool</a> or recorded in a bug/feature request 
					database (<a href="filing_bug_reports.html">CLDR Bug Reports</a>). Changes in response to requests in the database may be entered into the 
					repository snapshot over time by the maintainers of the repository, but the final approval of the release of any version of CLDR is up to 
					the decision of the CLDR Technical Committee.</p>
					<p>For more information on the formal procedures for the Unicode CLDR Technical Committee, see the
					<a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html">Technical Committee Procedures for the Unicode Consortium</a>.</p>
					<h2><a name="specification_changes"></a>2. Specification Changes</h2>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/">UTS #35: Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)</a> specification may be changed to add structure for new kinds of data or other features. Requests for changes are 
					entered in the bug/feature request database (<a href="filing_bug_reports.html">CLDR Bug Reports</a>).</p>
					<p>Structural changes are always backwards-compatible. That is, previous files will continue to work. Deprecated elements remain and can be 
					used, although their usage is strongly discouraged.</p>
					<p>There is a standing policy for structural changes that require non-trivial code for proper implementation, such as time zone fallback or alias 
					mechanisms. These require the existence of at least a prototype implementation that demonstrates correct function according to the proposed 
					specification.</p>
					<h2><a name="data_vetting_process"></a>3. Data Submission and Vetting Process</h2>
					<p>Once data for a country and language has been received, the data from the different sources will be compared to show agreements and differences. 
					Initial data contributions are normally marked as &quot;draft=provisional&quot;; this may be changed once the data is vetted.</p>
					<p>Note that there are two types of data in the repository:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Comparison data: </b>The contributor can be an individual or an organization. Data is normally gathered 
					by calling public APIs, to ensure that the data matches what is actually in use. The data is only for comparison, and will 
					not be changed except where necessary to update the data to match the external source. The only requirement is that all changed data be 
					versioned, and the Version Numbering Scheme be used.</li>
						<li><b>Common Data: </b>The contents is decided upon by the CLDR Technical Committee, following its procedures and this process.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Contributors are encouraged to use local language and country contacts, inside and outside their organization, to help vet current common data 
					and any new proposals for addition or amendment of common data. In particular, national standards organizations are encouraged to be involved 
					in the data vetting process.</p>
					<p>For CLDR to add a new language just requires that the proposer to commit to providing at least the minimal localization (exemplar 
					characters, months, days, 
					date/time formats, translations for a few countries, languages, currencies, etc.). 
					<span style="font-style:italic">The exemplar 
					characters, however, are required before the new locale can be added. </span>The new locale then becomes available for 
					additional translations and vetting during the next 
					review cycle.</p>
					<h3>3.1 <a name="resolution_procedure">Resolution Procedure</a></h3>
					<p>The following procedure is used when resolving differences in submitted data. At the end, for 
					each field a single value will be chosen as optimal, while the others will have an <i>alt=proposed</i> attribute. The <i>draft</i> attribute 
					on all the values will be 
					set to one of 4 states:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i><span style="font-weight:700; ">unconfirmed</span></i></li>
						<li><b><i>provisional</i></b></li>
						<li><b><i>contributed</i></b></li>
						<li><i><b>approved</b> (equivalent to an absent draft attribute)</i></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Implementations may choose the level at which they wish to accept data. They may choose to accept even 
					<b>unconfirmed</b> data, especially if 
					there is no translated alternative. Approved data is approved by the Technical Committee, as described by the resolution process below. This 
					does not mean that the data is guaranteed to be error-free -- this is simply the best judgment of the committee according to the process.</p>
					<h4>User Levels</h4>
					<p>There are multiple levels of access and control:</p>
					<p><i>Committee Vetters (Technical Committee (TC) members) </i></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Can vet and submit data for all locales </li>
						<li>Can manage users in their organization</li>
						<li>Can see the email addresses for all vetters </li>
					</ul>
					<p><i>Regular and Expert Vetter</i></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Can vet and submit data for a particular set of locales</li>
						<li>Cannot manage other users.</li>
						<li>Can see the email addresses for submitted data in their locales. </li>
					</ul>
					<p><i>Guest Vetters</i></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Can vet and submit data for a particular set of locales</li>
						<li>Cannot manage other users. </li>
						<li>Cannot see email addresses.</li>
					</ul>
<p>These levels are decided by the TC representative for the respective organizations. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Unicode TC members (full/associate/supporting) can assign its users to any level. </li>
	<li>Liaison or associate members can assign to Guest, or to other levels with approval of the TC.<ul>
	<li>The liaison/associate member him/erself gets TC status 
	in order to manage users, but gets a Guest status in terms of voting, unless the committee approves a higher level.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Users assigned to &quot;<a href="http://unicode.org">unicode.org</a>&quot; are normally assigned 
	as Guest, but the committee can assign a different level.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Voting</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Each user gets one vote on each value, but the <i>strength</i> of the vote varies according to the user level:<ul>
		<li>A Guest vote counts 1, a Vetter vote counts 4, and an Expert/TC vote counts 8</li>
		<li>If a user is locked or removed, then his/er vote is zero.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>All values with survey tool errors get zero votes<ul>
	<li>For example, a date pattern of &quot;14. september&quot; instead of &quot;dd MMM&quot;.</li>
	<li>They cannot be voted for, and show a visible error.</li>
	<li>Collision errors are an exception, and are not subject to this treatment.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>For each value, each organization gets a vote based on the <i>maximum</i> (not cumulative) strength of the votes of its users.<ul>
	<li>That is, even if an organization has 10 Vetters voting for an value, the vote count attributed to the 
	organization as a whole is 4 (the strength of 1 Vetter).</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>If there is a dispute (votes for different values) within an organization, then the majority vote for that 
	organization is chosen. If there is a tie, then no vote is counted for the organization.</li>
	<li>Batch data (marked with x999, for example) gets a status based on committee decision.</li>
</ul>
					<p>Any field that has no new submissions or votes during the data submission and vetting phase 
					remains the same in the next release. Any other fields are assessed as follows:</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Optimal Field Value</span></h4>
					<p>For each release, there is one optimal field value determined by the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add up the votes for each value from each organization.</li>
	<li>Out of all the possible alternative values for a given field, pick the one with the most votes. </li>
	If there was a tie, pick the least one (in UCA order).<ul>
	<li>An example of an error is where the value has a syntax error for a pattern.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Draft Status of Optimal Field Value</span></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Compare the optimal value&#39;s vote <span style="font-weight: bold; ">O </span>
	to the next highest vote getter <span style="font-weight: bold; ">N</span>, and assign the status according to the first of the conditions below that 
	applies. <font size="3">Assign the value G to the number of organizations that voted for the optimal value.</font><ul>
		<li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400">O <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font> 2<font face="Arial">×</font>N and O <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font> 8 votes: 
		draft status = </span>approved</li>
		<li>O <span style="font-weight: 400; "> <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font></span> 2<font face="Arial">×</font>N and O <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font> 2 votes and G <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font> 2: draft status =<b> contributed</b></li>
		<li>O <span style="font-weight: 400; "> <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font></span> N and O <font face="Times New Roman">≥</font> 2 votes: draft status =<b> provisional</b> </li>
		<li>Otherwise: draft status =<b> unconfirmed</b></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>An <b>approved</b> 
	value from the previous release (one that does not have an error and is not a fallback) remains <b>approved</b> unless 
	a different value would be <b>approved,</b> according to the above voting.<ul>
	<li>That is, if the new optimal value does not have the status of <b>approved</b>, and the previous release had an 
	<span style="font-weight: bold; ">approved </span>value (one that does not have an error and is not a fallback), then 
	that previously-released value stays <b>approved</b> and replaces the optimal value in the following steps.</li>
</ul>
					</li>
	<li>If the optimal value was the optimal value in the previous release, it keeps its previous status unless the new 
	status would be better, according to the above voting.</li>
	<li>If there was an <i>alt=proposed</i> on the optimal value, the <i>alt=proposed</i> is removed.</li>
</ul>
					<h4>Remaining Errors</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>After all other resolution is done, any remaining error values are removed.</li>
						<li>In the case of collisions, this is done by retaining one of the values (unless it has other errors) and removing the other (thus 
						removing the error on the first). The choice is based on which field is most commonly used.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If a locale does not have minimal data (at least at a provisional level), then it may be excluded from the release. Where this is done, 
					it is restored to the repository for the next submission cycle.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Status of Remaining Values</span></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Remaining values are marked with <i>alt=proposed </i>and given the draft status:<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 
	unconfirmed</span></li>
</ul>
					<p>This process can be fine-tuned by the Technical Committee as needed, to resolve any problems that turn up. A committee decision can also override any of the above process 
					for any specific values.</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 700; ">Notes:</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>If data has a formal problem, it can be fixed directly (in CVS) without going through the above process. Examples include:<ul>
							<li>syntactic problems in pattern, extra trailing spaces, inconsistent decimals, mechanical sweeps to change attributes, translatable 
							characters not quoted in patterns, changing &#39; (punctuation mark) to curly apostrophe or s-cedilla to s-comma-below, removing disallowed 
							exemplar characters (non-letter, number, mark, uppercase when there is a lowercase).</li>
							<li>These are changed in-place, without changing the draft status.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Linguistically-sensitive data should always go through the survey tool. Examples include:<ul>
							<li>names of months, territories, number formats, changing ASCII apostrophe to U+02BC modifier letter apostrophe or U+02BB modifier 
							letter turned comma, or U+02BD modifier letter reversed comma, adding/removing normal exemplar characters.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>The TC committee can authorize bulk submissions of new data directly (CVS), with all new data marked draft=&quot;unconfirmed&quot; 
						(or other status decided by the committee), but only where the data passes 
						the CheckCLDR console tests.</li>
						<li>The survey tool does not currently handle all CLDR data. For data it doesn&#39;t cover, the regular bug system is used to submit 
						new data or ask for revisions of this data. In particular:<ul>
							<li>Collation, transforms, or text segmentation, which are more complex.
							<ul>
								<li>For collation data, see the comparison charts at <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/comparison_charts.html">http://www.unicode.org/cldr/comparison_charts.html</a> 
								or the XML data at <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/data/common/collation/">http://unicode.org/cldr/data/common/collation/</a>
								</li>
								<li>For transforms, see the XML data at <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/data/common/transforms/">http://unicode.org/cldr/data/common/transforms/</a>

					</ul>
					<h3>3.2 <a name="Vetting_Process">Vetting Process</a></h3>
	<p>During the vetting phase, a field is <span style="font-weight: bold;">open </span>when:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>there are multiple possible alternative values for the field (eg, introduced during data submission)</li>
		<li>there is an error on a value for the field (error, not warning)</li>
		<li>the field is needed for minimal coverage (POSIX plus a few others) </li>
	</ul>
	Open fields can be affected during vetting:<ul>
		<li>votes changed (the voting is shown in the Zoomed view)</li>
		<li>values added via the Change column.</li>
		<li>values deleted (by the originator, if there are no other votes for the value)</li>
		<li>TC members can also make these changes to closed fields.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Open fields are sorted at the top of the page, in two categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>disputed</b>: there is no confirmed value for CLDR 1.5 according to the resolution process</li>
		<li><b>tentatively approved</b>: there <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>a confirmed value for CLDR 1.5</li>
	</ul>
	The icon for a field (<b>open</b> or <b>closed</b>) is the first of the following that applies:<ul>
		<li>An error or warning icon, where that is the status of the optimal value<ul>
			<li>Including a warning icon where there is no value for a field needed for minimal coverage</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>A check icon, if the optimal value is confirmed</li>
		<li>A question icon, if the field is open</li>
		<li>An equals icon, otherwise
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This process can be fine-tuned by the Technical Committee as needed, to resolve any problems that turn up.</p>
					<h3>3.3 <a name="prioritization">Prioritization</a></h3>
					<p>There may be conflicting common practices or standards for a given country and language. Thus LDML provides keyword variants to reflect the 
					different practices. For example, for German it allows the distinction between PHONEBOOK and DICTIONARY collation.</p>
					<p>When there is an existing national standard for a country that is widely accepted in practice, the goal is to follow that standard as much 
					as possible. Where the common practice in the country deviates from the national standard, or if there are multiple conflicting common practices, 
					or options in conforming to the national standard, or conflicting national standards, multiple variants may be entered into the CLDR, distinguished 
					by keyword variants or variant locale identifiers.</p>
					<p>Where a data value is identified as following a particular national standard (or other reference), the goal is to keep that data aligned with 
					that standard. There is, however, no guarantee that data will be tagged with any or all of the national standards that it follows.</p>
					<h3>3.4 <a name="Dot-Dot_Releases">Dot-Dot Releases</a></h3>
					<p>Dot-dot releases, such as 1.4.1, are issued whenever the standard identifiers change (that is, BCP 47 identifiers, Time zone identifiers, 
					or ISO 4217 Currency identifiers).&nbsp; Updates to identifiers will also mean updating the English names for those identifiers.</p>
					<p>Corrigenda may also be included in dot-dot releases. Dot-dot releases may also be issued if there are substantive changes to supplemental 
					(non-language) data. An example of supplemental data additions would be adding more transforms, or adding more script-language info.<br />
					<br />
					Normally there are no dot-dot releases for language data, but the committee may decide to issue one if the situation warrants. Normally 
					there are no major changes in the specification. </p>
					<p>The structure and DTD may change, but except for additions or for small bug fixes, data will not be changed in a way that would affect the 
					content of resolved data.</p>
					<h2>4. <a name="public_feedback">Public Feedback Process</a></h2>
					<p>The public can supply formal feedback into CLDR via the <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey/">Survey Tool</a> or by filing a <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Bug Report or Feature Request</a>. 
					There is also a public forum for questions at <a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html#cldr_list">CLDR Mailing List</a>
					(details on archives are found there).</p>
					<p>Anyone can also asked to be added to a list that will receive 
					notification of new CLDR bugs, so they can track issues if they want. Anyone can also to reply to any bug report to add comments or 
					questions.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To subscribe, send a note to &quot;ecartis+unicode.org&quot; (use an <i>at sign</i> instead of the +) and put &quot;subscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the subject 
						line.</li>
						<li>To unsubscribe, put &quot;unsubscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the subject line instead.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There is also a members-only <a href="http://www.unicode.org/members/index.html#cldr">
					CLDR mailing list</a> for members of the CLDR 
					Technical Committee.</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/review/">Public Review Issues</a> may be posted in cases where broader public feedback is desired on a particular 
					issue.</p>
					<p>Be aware that changes and updates to CLDR will only be taken in response to information entered in the <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey/">Survey Tool</a> 
					or by filing a <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Bug Report or Feature Request</a>. 
					Discussion on public mailing lists is <i>not</i> monitored; no actions will be taken in response to such discussion -- only in response to filed 
					bugs. The process of checking and entering data takes time and effort; so even when bugs/feature requests are accepted, it may take some time before they 
					are in a release of CLDR.</p>
					<h2><a name="data_release_process"></a>5. Data Release Process</h2>
					<h3>5.1 <a name="version_numbering">Version Numbering</a></h3>
					<p>The locale data is frozen per version. Once a version is released, it is never modified. Any changes, however minor, will mean a newer version 
					of the locale data being released. The versioning scheme is x.y.z, where z is incremented for bug fixes, y is incremented for any additions 
					(such as new locale data or LDML elements), and x is incremented for any major changes in format.</p>
					<h3>5.2 <a name="release_schedule">Release Schedule</a></h3>
					<p>Early releases of a version of the common locale data will be issued as either alpha or beta releases, available for public feedback. The 
					dates for the next scheduled release will be on <a href="index.html">CLDR Project</a>.</p>
					<p>The schedule milestones are:</p>
