          <h1>Unicode CLDR Technical Committee Process</h1>
          <h2><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>This document describes the CLDR Technical Committee, and its process for Data 
          Collection, Vetting, Public Feedback and Release. The process is 
			designed to be light-weight: in 
          particular, the meetings are frequent, short, and informal. Most of the 
          work is by email or phone, with a database recording requested changes in data.</p>
          <p>When gathering data for a region and language, it is important to have multiple sources 
          for that data to produce the most widely acceptable data. Initial versions of data 
			were based on the best available sources, but CLDR data will be 
          modified and improved, in successive versions, by more input from the contributors inside 
          and outside of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that CLDR is a Repository, not a Registration. That is, 
          contributors should not expect that their contributions will simply be adopted into the 
          repository; instead, it will be vetted against the best available information.</p>
          <p>All inputs are be open, and recorded in a bug/feature request 
			database or <a href="survey_tool.html">CLDR Survey Tool</a>. Changes in 
          response to items the database may be entered into the repository snapshot over time by 
          the maintainers of the repository, but the final approval of the release of any version of CLDR is up to the decision of the CLDR-TC.</p>
			<p>For more information on the formal procedures for the CLDR 
			Technical Committee, see the
			<a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html">
			Technical Committee Procedures for the Unicode Consortium</a>.</p>
          <h2><a name="specification_changes"></a>2. Specification Changes</h2>
          <p>The LDML specification may be changed to add structure for new kinds of data or other 
          features. Requests for changes are also entered in the bug/feature request database.</p>
          <p>Structural changes are always backwards-compatible. That is, previous files will 
          continue to work. Deprecated elements remain and can be used, although their usage is 
          strongly discouraged.</p>
          <p>There is a standing policy for structural changes that require non-trivial code for 
          proper implementation, such as timezone fallback or alias mechanisms. These require the 
          existence of at least a prototype implementation that demonstrates correct function 
          according to the proposed specification.</p>
          <h2><a name="data_vetting_process"></a>3. Data Vetting Process</h2>
          <p>Once data for a country and language has been received, the data from the different 
          sources will be compared to show agreements and differences. Initial data contributions 
          are normally marked as &quot;draft=provisional&quot;; this 
			may be changed once the data is vetted.</p>
          <p>Note that there are two types of data in the repository:</p>
          <p>a) Comparison data: The contributor can be an individual or an organization. Data from 
          a software platform or product, is normally gathered by calling public APIs, to ensure 
          that the data matches what is actually in use. In either case, the data is only for 
          comparison, and <i>will not be changed</i> except where necessary to update the data to 
          match the external source. The only requirement is that all changed data be versioned, and 
          the Version Numbering Scheme be used.</p>
          <p>b) Common Data: The contents is decided upon by the CLDR-TC, following its procedures 
          and this process.</p>
          <p>Data contributed to CLDR from different sources may be in conflict. For example, a 
          contribution on abbreviated month names may show each abbreviated name ending with a 
          period and another contribution for the same abbreviated month names may not show the 
          trailing period.</p>
          <p>Members are encouraged to use local language and country contacts, inside and outside 
          their organization, to help vet current common data and any new proposals for addition or 
          amendment of common data. In particular, national standards organizations are encouraged 
          to be involved in the data vetting process.</p>
          <h3>3.1 <a name="resolution_procedure">Resolution Procedure</a></h3>
          <p>The following procedure 
			will be used when resolving differences in submitted data.</p>
			<p>There are multiple levels 
			of access and control:<br>
			<br>
			<i>Committee Vetters (Technical 
			Committee members) </i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can vet and submit 
				data for all locales </li>
				<li>Can manage users in 
				their organization</li>
				<li>Can see the email 
				addresses for all vetters </li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>Regular and Expert Vetter</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can vet and submit 
				data for a particular set of locales</li>
				<li>Cannot manage other 
				users.</li>
				<li>Can see the email 
				addresses for submitted data in their locales. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>Guest Vetters</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can vet and submit 
				data for a particular set of locales</li>
				<li>Cannot manage other 
				users. </li>
				<li>Cannot see email 
				addresses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A <i>
			locale group</i> 
			is the set of all locales that share the same first field. For 
			example, en plus anything that starts with &quot;en_&quot;. The group of 
			non-guest vetters who are authorized for a locale group is called the
			<i>interest group</i> 
			for the locale.<br>
			<br>
			Fields with multiple proposals where some non-guest vetters do not 
			agree on a single proposal are called <i>
			conflicted</i>. 
			Correspondingly, a locale with any conflicted fields is a <i>
			conflicted locale</i>; 
			a locale group with any conflicted locales is a <i>
			conflicted locale group</i>.
			</p>
			<p>The <i>draft</i> 
			attribute in the data can have 3 states:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i><span style="font-weight:700">unconfirmed</span><b>:</b></i> 
				entered by guest vetter without other confirmation, or 
				conflicted. (Equals CLDR 1.3 draft value of <b> <i>true.</i></b>)</li>
				<li><b><i>provisional</i></b><i><b>:</b></i> 
				entered by regular vetter (or above), without conflict, but not 
				yet approved. 
				Implementations may choose to accept the provisional data, 
				especially if there is no translated alternative.</li>
				<li><i><b>approved:</b> </i>approved by the Technical Committee, as described by the 
				resolution process below. This does not mean that 
				the data is guaranteed to be error-free -- this is the best 
				judgment of the committee. (Equals the CLDR 1.3 draft value 
				of <i>
				<span style="font-weight:700">false</span></i>, 
				or an absent <i>draft</i> attribute.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the vetting phase:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any vetter, 
				including guest vetters, can see a summary of all the 
				conflicted fields for a given locale group.</li>
				<li>Vetters can change 
				their preferred value (a vote). </li>
				<li>Anyone on the 
				interest group is notified (batched daily) if 
				a vote is changed.</li>
				<li>For each conflicted 
				locale group, periodically (weekly at first, then daily) an 
				email is sent to the interest group summarizing all the 
				conflicted fields. The email will encourage the interest group 
				to resolve any conflicts. The interest group will also have 
				access to all the vetters&#39; emails for the locale group, to 
				ask questions and resolve issues.</li>
				<li>Normally the &quot;change 
				to&quot; button is frozen during the 
				<span id="mail-highlight-id">
				vetting process</span>, 
				except for committee and expert vetters. However, when a field 
				has any proposals, the &quot;change to&quot; button is enabled for non-guest vetters.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the end of the 
			<span id="mail-highlight-id">
			vetting process:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>All non-conflicted 
				fields that meet a quorum are normally approved.</li>
				<li>Once a field is 
				approved, the other proposals for that 
				field are removed (or made into alternates, according to Technical Committee 
				decision).</li>
				<li>The quorum is at 
				least one expert vetter, or at least two regular vetters from different 
				organizations.</li>
				<li>If the quorum is not 
				met, then the data remains, marked as draft=&quot;unconfirmed&quot; if it 
				has no votes, or draft=&quot;provisional&quot; if it has at least one 
				vote.</li>
				<li>The Technical Committee 
				may decide to make a particular conflicted field <i>approved</i>, or 
				have it remain conflicted 
				(thus
				<i>provisional </i>or<i> unconfirmed</i>).</li>
				<li>The Technical 
				Committee is ultimately responsible for resolving any issues.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This process can be 
			fine-tuned by the Technical Committee as needed, to resolve any 
			problems that turn up.</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 700; ">Notes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>If data has a formal 
				problem, it can be fixed directly (in CVS) without going through 
				the above process. Examples include:<ul>
					<li>syntactic 
					problems in pattern, extra trailing spaces, inconsistent 
					decimals, mechanical sweeps to change attributes, 
					translatable characters not quoted in patterns, changing &#39; 
					(punctuation mark) to curly apostrophe or s-cedilla to 
					s-comma-below, removing disallowed exemplar characters 
					(non-letter, number, mark, uppercase when there is a 
					lowercase).</li>
					<li>These are 
					changed in-place, without changing the draft status.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Bulk submissions of 
				new data can be done directly (CVS), with all new data marked 
				draft=&quot;unconfirmed&quot;, but only where the data passes the 
				CheckCLDR console tests.</li>
				<li>Linguistically-sensitive data should always go through the 
				survey tool. Examples include:<ul>
					<li>names of months, 
					territories, number formats, changing ascii apostrophe to 
					U+02BC modifier letter apostrophe or U+02BB modifier letter 
					turned comma, or U+02BD modifier letter reversed comma, 
					adding/removing normal exemplar characters.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The survey tool does 
				not currently handle all CLDR data. For data it doesn&#39;t cover, 
				the regular bug system should be used to submit new data or ask 
				for revisions of this data. In particular:<ul>
					<li>Collation, 
					transforms, or text segmentation, which are more complex.
					<ul>
						<li>For 
						collation data, see the comparison charts at 
						<a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/comparison_charts.html">

          <h3>3.2 <a name="prioritization">Prioritization</a></h3>
          <p>There may be conflicting common practices or standards for a given country and 
          language. Thus LDML provides keyword variants to reflect the different practices. For 
          example, for German it allows the distinction between PHONEBOOK and DICTIONARY collation.</p>
          <p>When there is an existing national standard for a country that is widely accepted in 
          practice, the goal is to follow that standard as much as possible. Where the common 
          practice in the country deviates from the national standard, or if there are multiple 
          conflicting common practices, or options in conforming to the national standard, or 
          conflicting national standards, multiple variants may be entered into the CLDR, 
          distinguished by keyword variants or variant locale identifiers.</p>
          <p>Where a data item is identified as following a particular national standard (or other 
          reference), the goal is to keep that data aligned with that standard. There is, however, 
          no guarantee that data will be tagged with any or all of the national standards that it 
          follows.</p>
          <h3>3.3 Dot-Dot Releases</h3>
			<p>Dot-dot releases, such as 1.4.1, are issued whenever the standard 
			identifiers change (that is, BCP 47 identifiers, Timezone 
			identifiers, or ISO 4217 Currency identifiers).&nbsp; Updates to 
			identifiers will also mean updating the English names for those 
			identifiers.</p>
			<p>Corrigenda may also be included in dot-dot releases. Dot-dot 
			releases may also be issued if there are substantive changes to 
			supplemental (non-language) data. An example of supplemental data 
			additions would be adding more transforms, or adding more 
			script-language info.<br>
			<br>
			Normally there are not have dot-dot releases for language data, but 
			the committee may decide to issue one if the situation warrants. 
			Normally there are no major changes in the specification. </p>
			<p>The structure and DTD may change, but except for additions or for 
			small bug fixes, data will not be changed in a way that would affect 
			the content of resolved data.</p>
          <h2>4. <a name="public_feedback">Public Feedback Process</a></h2>
          <p>The public can supply formal feedback into CLDR by filing a
          <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Bug Report or Feature Request (RFE)</a> 
			or via the <b>
			<a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey/">
			Survey Tool</a></b>. Anyone can also 
          asked to be added to a list that will receive notification of new CLDR bugs, so they can 
          track issues if they want. Anyone will also be able to reply to any bug/rfe, to add 
          comments (this latter feature is not yet functional, but will be soon).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To subscribe, send a note to &quot;ecartis+unicode.org&quot; (use an <i>at sign</i> instead of 
            the +) and put &quot;subscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the subject line.</li>
            <li>To unsubscribe, put &quot;unsubscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the&nbsp;subject line instead.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The email archive (in raw form) are in the
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/~ecartis/cldr/">CLDR Email Archives</a>.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/review/">Public Review Issues</a> may be posted in 
          cases where broader public feedback is desired on a particular issue.</p>
          <p>The public is also free to discuss locale issues on the Unicode list
          <a href="mailto:(unicode@unicode.org">unicode@unicode.org</a>, which is devoted to Unicode 
          and related globalization standards (see
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html">Mail Lists</a> to subscribe).</p>
          <p>People should, however, be aware that changes and updates to CLDR will only be taken in 
          response to complete, specific bug reports as described on
          <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Filing Bug Reports</a> 
			or via the <b>
			<a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey/">
			Survey Tool</a></b>. Discussion on public mailing 
          lists is <i>not</i> monitored; no actions will be taken in response to such discussion -- 
          only in response to filed bugs. The process of checking and entering data takes time and 
          effort; so even when bugs/RFEs are accepted, it may take some time before they are in a 
          release of CLDR.</p>
          <h2><a name="data_release_process"></a>5. Data Release Process</h2>
          <h3>5.1 <a name="version_numbering">Version Numbering</a></h3>
          <p>The locale data is frozen per version. Once a version is released, it is never 
          modified. Any changes, however minor, will mean a newer version of the locale data being 
          released. The versioning scheme is x.y.z, where z is incremented for bug fixes, y is 
          incremented for any additions (such as new locale data or LDML elements), and x is 
          incremented for any major changes in format.</p>
