          <h1>Unicode releases Common Locale Data Repository, Version 1.3</h1>
          <p>Mountain View, CA, May 31, 2005 - The Unicode® Consortium announced today the release 
          of new versions of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR 1.3) and the Locale Data Markup 
          Language specification (LDML 1.3), providing key building blocks for software to support 
          the world&#39;s languages. CLDR is by far the largest standard repository of locale data. This 
          new release contains data for 299 locales: 97 languages and 130 territories. For the first 
          time in this release, POSIX formatted data is also available.</p>
          <p>To support users in different languages, programs must not only use translated text, 
          but must also be adapted to local conventions. These conventions differ by language or 
          region and include the formatting of numbers, dates, times, and currency values, as well 
          as support for differences in measurement units or text sorting order. Most operating 
          systems and many application programs currently maintain their own repositories of locale 
          data to support these conventions. But such data are often incomplete, idiosyncratic, or 
          gratuitously different from program to program. In the age of the internet, software 
          components must work together seamlessly, without the problems caused by these 
          discrepancies. </p>
          <p>The CLDR project provides a general XML format, LDML, for the exchange of locale 
          information used in application and system software development, combined with a public 
          repository for a common set of locale data in that format. In this release, there are 
          major additions to the CLDR data, to the LDML specification, and in implementation 
          support.</p>
          <p>For more information about the CLDR project, with details about the new features in 
          this release and the languages and territories supported, see
