          <h1>Unicode releases Common Locale Data Repository, Version 1.2</h1>
          <p>Mountain View, CA, November 2, 2004 - The Unicode® Consortium announced today the 
          release of new versions of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR 1.2) and the Locale 
          Data Markup Language specification (LDML 1.2), providing key building blocks for software 
          to support the world&#39;s languages. This new release contains data for 232 locales, covering 
          72 languages and 108 countries. There are also 63 draft locales in the process of being 
          developed, covering an additional 27 languages and 28 countries. </p>
          <p>To support users in different languages, programs must not only use translated text, 
          but must also be adapted to local conventions. These conventions differ by language or 
          region and include the formatting of numbers, dates, times, and currency values, as well 
          as support for differences in measurement units or text sorting order. Most operating 
          systems and many application programs currently maintain their own repositories of locale 
          data to support these conventions. But such data are often incomplete, idiosyncratic, or 
          gratuitously different from program to program. In the age of the internet, software 
          components must work together seamlessly, without the problems caused by these 
          discrepancies. </p>
          <p>The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) provides a general XML format (LDML) for the 
          exchange of locale information for use in application and system software development, 
          combined with a public repository for a common set of locale data in that format. In this 
          release, the major additions to CLDR are: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Additions of many language, territory, and script names, many currency names and 
            symbols, many timezone names, many type names (names of calendars, collations, etc); 
            compaction of the data by removal of inherited or aliased data; and changes to Chinese 
            collation names. </li>
            <li>Enhancement of the LDML specification to add approximately 40% more information, 
            covering date format patterns, number format patterns, choice patterns, inheritance and 
            validity, time zone fallbacks, and providing a lists of all valid attribute values. 
            Structure has been added to assist in vetting and to mark vetted locales, to allow for 
            multiple sets of exemplar characters (indicating characters in use in particular 
            locales), to represent relative dates and times, and to strengthen the alias mechanism 
            by adding XPath sources.</li>
            <li>Conformance tests to allow people to test their implementation of collation for 
            different languages.</li>
            <li>For comparison of data, by-type charts and vetting charts were added.</li>
            <li>The CLDR source is now independent of ICU.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><i><b>Note: </b>The freeze date for the next version of CLDR is January 15, 2004. All 
          new data or defect reports for CLDR 1.3 must be submitted by then.</i></p>
