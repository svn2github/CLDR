              <h1>Common Locale Data Repository Technical Committee Procedures</h1>
              <h2><a name="1"></a>1. Scope</h2>
              <p>These procedures are to guide all activity of the Locale Data Technical Committee (CLDR-TC) except where explicitly overruled by action of Unicode, Inc. (the 
              Unicode Consortium).</p>
              <p>These procedures are established and amended by the Officers of the Unicode Consortium under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
              <h2><a name="2"></a>2. Function of the CLDR-TC</h2>
              <p>The principal activities of the CLDR-TC are the development and maintenance of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) and associated Technical Reports in 
              accordance with the purpose of the Unicode Consortium as stated in Article 1, Section 1 of its Bylaws. In particular, this includes the development and release of&nbsp; 
              <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/">UTS #35: Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)</a>. The content of the CLDR repository and associated Technical Reports is 
              defined by the set of proposals approved by the CLDR-TC, on the basis of these procedures and the <a href="process.html">CLDR Process</a>.</p>
              <h2><a name="3"></a>3. Composition of the CLDR-TC</h2>
              <p>The CLDR-TC is comprised of representatives of Full Members of the Unicode Consortium (i.e. &quot; member&quot; as defined by the current Bylaws of Unicode, Inc.) 
              in good standing. In the rest of these procedures, any use of the term &quot;member&quot; without qualification refers to this definition in the current Bylaws of 
              Unicode, Inc.</p>
              <p>A member representative must be listed as a primary or alternate representative on the Membership Roster of Unicode Inc. to represent the member.</p>
              <h3>3.1. Definition of “good standing”</h3>
              <p>To be in good standing, a member is required to be current on fees and obligations imposed by the Unicode Consortium.</p>
              <h2><a name="4"></a>4. Member representatives</h2>
              <h3>4.1. Primary representative</h3>
              <p>Each Full Member of the Unicode Consortium is entitled to designate one person as its primary representative at CLDR-TC meetings. This designation must be made in 
              writing (which may be by email).</p>
              <h3>4.2. Alternate representatives</h3>
              <p>In addition, each Full Member may designate one or more alternate representatives. This designation must be made in writing (which may be by email).</p>
              <h3>4.3. Changes in assigned representatives</h3>
              <p>A Full Member may revoke or reassign its assigned representatives at any time. Notice of changes must be in writing (which may be by email).</p>
              <h2><a name="5"></a>5. Proxy representation</h2>
              <p>A CLDR-TC Full Member may designate a proxy for a given period or subject matter. This designation must be made in writing, either by email or fax. If by letter, 
              the designation must be signed by the primary representative or by an alternate representative acting as the primary representative. Appointment of a proxy orally is 
              not acceptable.</p>
              <p>Proxies may be revoked at any time by the primary representative or by an alternate representative acting as the primary representative. The revocation must be in 
              writing if the representative is not physically present at the meeting.</p>
              <p>The proxy authorization or revocation must be sent to the Chair in advance of the CLDR-TC meeting or presented to the Presiding Chair at the meeting. A proxy 
              cannot vote unless the proxy authorization has been presented and validated by the Chair in advance or by the Presiding Chair during the meeting.</p>
              <h3>5.1. Who may be a proxy</h3>
              <p>The CLDR-TC imposes no restrictions on who may be a proxy. It may be the representative of another member, a CLDR-TC Officer, or an Officer of the Consortium or 
              any other chosen person.</p>
              <h3>5.2. When is a proxy not required</h3>
              <p>A proxy is not required when a member is being represented by an alternate representative (instead of the principal representative). The alternate representative 
              must be listed on the Membership Roster of Unicode Inc.</p>
              <h2><a name="6"></a>6. CLDR-TC Officers</h2>
              <p>The officers of the CLDR-TC are a Chairman or Chairwoman (“Chair”), and a Vice Chairman or Vice Chairwoman (“Vice Chair”). In the absence of the Chair, the 
              Vice Chair shall assume his/her duties. Other officers of the CLDR-TC may be appointed by a vote of the CLDR-TC at its discretion.</p>
              <h2><a name="7"></a>7. Meetings</h2>
              <p>CLDR-TC meetings shall be numbered consecutively. Normally meetings are held by phone, approximately every 2 to 4 weeks. Locations and dates for a CLDR-TC meeting 
              shall be decided upon by the CLDR-TC, and notification distributed to the CLDR-TC membership at least 7 days in advance of the meeting.</p>
              <p>A member is not obligated to send a representative to a CLDR-TC meeting.</p>
              <h3>7.1. Meeting procedures</h3>
              <p><u>7.1.1. Presiding Chair</u></p>
              <p>The Chair presides over a CLDR-TC meeting. In the absence of the Chair, the Vice Chair presides.</p>
              <p><u>7.1.2. Appointment of a temporary CLDR-TC Officer</u></p>
              <p>During a CLDR-TC meeting, any CLDR-TC officer may appoint a member representative or Officer of the Unicode Consortium as a substitute CLDR-TC officer for all or 
              part of that meeting. This action must be recorded in the Minutes.</p>
              <p><u>7.1.3. Rules</u></p>
              <p>Meetings of the CLDR-TC shall be conducted in accordance with the latest edition of Robert's Rules of Order except as otherwise provided in these procedures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Robert's Rules shall not apply when strict adherence would conflict with special rules as set forth in its Scope and Program of Work Bylaws.</li>
                <li>At the discretion of the Presiding Chair, discussion may be conducted informally, especially on technical matters, unless any member objects.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>7.2. Who may participate in CLDR-TC meetings</h3>
              <p>Those who may participate in CLDR-TC meetings are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Representatives of Full Members</li>
                <li>Representatives of Associate Members</li>
                <li>Specialist Members</li>
                <li>Officers of the Unicode Consortium</li>
                <li>Liaison Members</li>
                <li>National body representatives</li>
                <li>Invited guests with respect to their area of expertise.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Individual Members, and all others present at the meeting have observer status.</p>
              <h3>7.3. Tape or video recording of meetings</h3>
              <p>Audio or video recording of meetings is normally not permitted. In exceptional circumstances, the Presiding Chair may waive this rule, provided that all voting 
              members and Consortium Officers present at the meeting consent to the waiver.</p>
              <p>If permission to record a meeting is not requested, the Presiding Chair may confiscate the recording, and ask the person responsible for the unauthorized recording 
              to leave the meeting.</p>
              <h3>7.4. Closed caucus</h3>
              <p>A proposal for a closed caucus can be raised at any time in a meeting. If the proposal is approved (according to Section 9 Decisions), all except Consortium 
              officers and representatives of Full Members shall be excused. Closed caucus proceedings may not be recorded by tape or video.</p>
              <h2><a name="8"></a>8. Meeting quorum</h2>
              <p>The quorum for a CLDR-TC meeting consists of fifty percent (50%) of the total number of members in good standing who are represented or have been represented at at 
              least one of the two prior meetings.</p>
              <p>A member may be represented either by a designated representative or by a validated proxy.</p>
              <h2><a name="9"></a>9. Decisions</h2>
              <p>Decisions of the CLDR-TC are made by consensus where possible, and otherwise by formal motions.&nbsp; Proposals may be made by any member representative (either 
              primary or alternate) or by an Officer of the Consortium. If no voting representative objects to a consensus, the proposal is accepted by the CLDR-TC. If there is an 
              objection to consensus, then the proposal can be withdrawn or a formal motion can be made. Motions may be moved or seconded by a member representative (either primary 
              or alternate) or by an Officer of the Consortium. A motion must be seconded before it can be voted upon. Acceptance of the motion is governed by Section 10 Voting.&nbsp;</p>
              <h2><a name="10"></a>10. Voting</h2>
              <h3>10.1. Who may vote</h3>
              <p>Voting at a CLDR-TC meeting is by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Representatives of Full Members in good standing</li>
                <li>Proxies whose authorization has been validated</li>
                <li>The Presiding Chair when functioning as the representative of a Full Member.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Where one or more representatives of a member is present, the principal representative will vote for the member, unless he/she allows an alternate representative 
              to vote instead.</p>
              <p>In the absence of the principal representative, an alternate representative votes for the member. When two or more alternates are present, the alternates decide 
              who shall represent the member in voting. In any case of conflict, the Presiding Chair shall decide who shall vote for the member.</p>
              <h3>10.2. Who may not vote</h3>
              <p>The representative of a Full Member not in good standing cannot vote on a CLDR-TC ballot. Participation in CLDR-TC activities other than voting will be at the 
              discretion of the Presiding Chair.</p>
              <h3>10.3. Rights of proxies</h3>
              <p>A proxy holding a validated authorization has the same voting rights as the member that he/she is representing.</p>
              <h3>10.4. Absentee voting</h3>
              <p>A member representative may cast a ballot on any matter by letter, telegram, fax, or equivalent written mechanism, provided only that such a ballot is received in 
              time to apply it. If any change other than correction of typographical errors is made to the wording or substance of a matter following receipt of a ballot, that 
              ballot shall, at the discretion of the Chair, not be voted.</p>
              <h3>10.5. Voting process</h3>
              <p>A vote on a motion is always taken on whether or not to approve the proposal. A vote is never taken on whether or not to sustain an objection to the proposal. 
              Votes may be cast in favor, against, or abstaining on any matter except on those matters for which abstentions are not permitted by CLDR-TC procedures.</p>
              <p>At a CLDR-TC meeting, voting is public, by count of those voting (including absentee votes).</p>
              <h3>10.6. Voting results</h3>
              <p><u>10.6.1. New decisions</u></p>
              <p>A special majority is required to pass a motion that would modify a precedent or introduce a non-backwards-compatible XML format change in LDML. Otherwise passage 
              of a motion is decided by a simple majority vote, whereby a matter will be deemed to have passed only if the number of votes in favor exceeds the number of votes 
              against.</p>
              <p><u>10.6.2. Precedents</u></p>
              <p>A precedent is established by a separate motion, which must pass by a special majority. This separate motion states that a previous CLDR-TC decision is considered 
              an explicit precedent.</p>
              <p><u>10.6.3. Special majority</u></p>
              <p>Unless otherwise decided by the Unicode Officers or the Board of Directors, the special majority is a 2/3 majority, whereby a matter will be deemed to have passed 
              only if the number of votes in favor equals or exceeds twice the number of votes against.</p>
              <h3>10.7. Approval voting</h3>
              <p>When multiple, conflicting proposals are being considered, a voting member, Officer, or the Presiding Chair may ask to have the CLDR-TC consider all proposals 
              simultaneously. The choice among the conflicting proposals will be decided by an approval ballot, whereby for each proposal a vote of members finding that proposal 
              acceptable will be counted. Members may vote for more than one proposal. The proposal with the largest number of votes becomes the decision of the CLDR-TC. There is 
              one exception: where that proposal would require a special majority and does not achieve it, then among the proposals that do not require a special majority, the one 
              with the largest number of acceptable votes wins. If there is a tie in any case, the chair will decide among the tied proposals.</p>
              <h3>10.8. Recording of decisions</h3>
              <p>The outcome of a decision is recorded in the Minutes of a CLDR-TC meeting. Votes are recorded with a count of the number of voting members who voted in favor, 
              against, and abstained. Decisions shall be recorded in the following matters:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ballots on motions related to a proposed standard, including all votes on proposals, objections, etc.</li>
                <li>Ballots on motions related to committee procedures.</li>
                <li>Ballots on matters related to the scopes and programs of work of CLDR-TC and its subcommittees.</li>
                <li>For an acceptance vote, the Minutes shall record the number of acceptable votes for each proposal.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Decisions on any other matters may be voice votes or informal unrecorded counts at the discretion of the Chair.</p>
              <h2><a name="11"></a>11. Letter ballots</h2>
              <p>A letter ballot may be called by a vote of the CLDR-TC or by at least two Officers of the Unicode Consortium. When a letter ballot is taken, the Chair shall 
              designate a Teller to conduct the ballot in the following manner:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ballots will be mailed, e-mailed, or distributed by hand to all members and alternates and must be returned to the Teller within 20 days of the date of 
                  distribution.</li>
                <li>Only one member representative may vote. Should ballots be received from more than one representative of a member, only the ballot of the principal 
                  representative is counted, and the ballot(s) of the alternate(s) shall be marked invalid.</li>
                <li>As soon as enough votes have been collected to decide the issue definitively one way or another, the Teller shall close the ballot and announce the results via 
                  e-mail to all principal and alternate representatives and to all Consortium Officers.</li>
                <li>Results of the letter ballot shall also be announced at the first CLDR-TC meeting following the close of the 20-day return period, and also recorded in the 
                  Minutes of the meeting.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2><a name="12"></a>12. Public Review Issues</h2>
              <p>From time to time the Unicode Consortium seeks formal public review and feedback on specific proposals by posting <a href="http://www.unicode.org/review/">public 
              review issues</a> on its website. Public review issues are created by Officers of the Consortium, typically upon request of the CLDR-TC or other technical committees.</p>
              <p>For CLDR-TC consideration, feedback on an issue must be submitted via the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reporting.html">online contact form</a>; indicating the 
              number and title of the issue. Resolution of a public review issue is normally made after consideration of the feedback at the following CLDR-TC meeting. The CLDR-TC 
              decisions are not bound in any way by the existence or the wording of a public review issue.</p>
              <h2><a name="13"></a>13. Subcommittees</h2>
              <p>Subcommittees may be established by the CLDR-TC to address specific issues. All proposals made by a Subcommittee are subject to approval or further action by the 
              CLDR-TC.</p>
              <p>The conduct of a Subcommittee meeting may, at the discretion of the Chair of that Subcommittee, be less formal than the CLDR-TC rules require. There is no specific 
              requirement for the advance notice of a Subcommittee meeting. Subcommittee meetings may also be held in closed caucus.</p>
              <h3>13.1. Who may participate in Subcommittee meetings</h3>
              <p>All those who can participate in CLDR-TC meetings may participate in Subcommittee meetings.</p>
              <h3>13.2. Subcommittee Chair</h3>
              <p>The Chair of a Subcommittee must be an Officer of the Consortium or a representative (principal or alternate) of a Full Member.</p>
              <h3>13.3. Reporting requirements</h3>
              <p>The Chair of a Subcommittee must report to the CLDR-TC on meetings of that Subcommittee.</p>
              <h2><a name="14"></a>14. The Unicode Consortium as a member of other organizations</h2>
              <p>Relationships with other organizations are at the level of the Unicode Consortium, not at the level of the Locale Data Technical Committee. For more information, 
              see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/policies/policies.html">Unicode Policies</a>.</p>
              <h2><a name="15"></a>15. Documentation</h2>
              <h3>15.1. Mailing lists</h3>
              <p>The Chair shall designate a person to maintain two mailing lists, one open to only representatives of Full Members, and one for representatives of all classes of 
              members plus invited experts.</p>
              <h3>15.2. Calendar of meetings</h3>
              <p>The calendar of CLDR-TC meetings shall be available on the public side of the Unicode Consortium Web site. The calendar will also show dates for International 
              Unicode Conferences, SC2/WG2, SC2/WG3, SC2 Plenary, SC22/WG20 and IRG meetings, and any other events or meetings of interest.</p>
              <h3>15.3. Agenda of meeting</h3>
              <p>All members of the email lists may submit items to the Chair for inclusion in the agenda. Additional agenda items may be added after the initial agenda is 
              distributed, up to and during the meeting itself. The inclusion of submitted items is at the discretion of the Chair and Vice Chair.</p>
              <h3>15.4. Meeting documents</h3>
              <p><u>15.4.1. Identification</u></p>
              <p>The Chair shall designate a person or procedure to assign document numbers. Documents shall be numbered according to the L2 scheme.</p>
              <p><u>15.4.2. Distribution</u></p>
              <p>Documents to be considered at meetings of the CLDR-TC shall be distributed not later than two business days before the meeting. Later documents may, at the 
              discretion of the Chair, be processed, if there is a need for CLDR-TC action to meet a schedule for standardization or for coordination with another group.</p>
              <p>When a proposal is introduced for the first time in a meeting, any voting member can ask for the decision to be delayed to the next meeting, to allow time for 
              study. The Chair will&nbsp; normally honor the request, except where the delay would cause a delay in the release.</p>
              <h3>15.5. Meeting Minutes</h3>
              <p>The Minutes of a CLDR-TC meeting shall be made available within one week of the meeting, by email.</p>
              <h2><a name="16"></a>16. Enforcement of these procedures</h2>
              <p>During a meeting, the Presiding Chair shall decide any question concerning interpretation or application of these rules. Outside a meeting, the Chair of the CLDR-TC 
              shall decide any question concerning interpretation or application of these rules.</p>
