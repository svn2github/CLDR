          <h1>Unicode CLDR Survey Tool</h1>
			<p>Most of the data in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository is 
			gathered and processed via what is called the Survey Tool. This is 
			an online tool that can be used to view data for different languages and propose additions 
			or changes.
			<wbr>This tool has been 
			substantially
			enhanced for the current release, and a forum has been added to allow
			communication between translators.</p>
			<p>During the current data submission period, contributors from Unicode 
			Consortium members, other organizations and the public at large are 
			invited to review the data for their languages and countries, and 
			propose new translations of terms or modifications,
			including language translations entirely new to the repository. In 
			this release, new
			structure has been added to the repository to improve representation
			of time zones, ranges of dates and the usage of languages.</p>
			<h2>Accounts</h2>
			<p>If you simply wish to view the data for a particular language, 
			you don&#39;t need an account. If you wish to propose changes or 
			additions, you will need one: see
			<a class="wikipagelink" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/wiki?SurveyToolAccounts">Survey Tool Accounts</a>.</p>
			<h2>Locale List</h2>The main screen of the survey tool is located at
			<a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey">http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey</a>. It displays a list of 
			languages currently available. Languages will vary by script (Arabic 
			vs. Latin, or Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese), and occasionally 
			by country. (For historic reasons, this combination of language with 
			script or country is known as a <i>locale</i>).<p>For each language, 
			the content is what is appropriate for the most populous country, 
			thus the content for <i>English</i> [en] is whatever is appropriate 
			for the United States. Any variation by country for that language 
			will be represented in a country locale: thus content appropriate 
			for the Australia that differs from what is in <i>English</i> [en] 
			will be in a the sublocale <i>English (Australia) </i>[en_AU].</p>
			<p>Click on the languages (optionally countries) which you would 
			like to view. You can always get back to this page by clicking on
			<em>Locales</em> at the top left of the page. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you have permission to modify a locale, after the locale 
				you will see the
				<img alt="The image “http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/hand.png” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/hand.png"> 
				symbol. </li>
				<li>If you would like to add data for a <em>new</em> locale, 
				please notify your CLDR contact. He or she can add an empty 
				locale which can then have data added into it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Reviewing and Submitting Data</h2>There is a key explaining the 
			way the windows are laid out at
			<a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/data/docs/survey/windows.html">
			Survey Tool Windows</a>. You should review this before starting. You 
			will then start going through each section: <i>languages</i>, <i>
			scripts</i>, <i>territories</i>, ... all the way to <i>supplemental</i>.<ul>
			<li>As you go through the sections, you will generally review the 
			Priority items (if any), and fix or add translations.
			<ul>
				<li>Click on the right option, if it is there. </li>
				<li>Otherwise click on &quot;<i>change to</i>&quot;, then type in the 
				fixed or new text.</li>
				<li><em><b>Important</b>:</em> before you leave any page, click 
				on the <b>Save</b> button to save your changes. It&#39;s also a good 
				idea to do this if you are spending a lot of time on a page, 
				just in case there is a problem.</li>
				<li>Control-F to find something on the page is really useful in 
				moving around on these pages, as are Page up and Page down keys. 
				You can also switch between ordering items by <b>Priority</b> vs
				<b>Code</b>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>More information is in the &quot;Zoomed&quot; view, so be sure to look at 
			that if you have any questions. It&#39;s also a good idea to zoom in on 
			at least one item in each section, to review any information for 
			that section.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2><strong>Coverage</strong></h2>
			<p>The warnings about missing items are based on your <i>coverage 
			level.</i> </p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you are from a Unicode member organization, your default 
				coverage level will be set for you. This will flag a number of 
				items for your translation using alert icons, from 
				&quot;comprehensive&quot; (all possible items) down to &quot;basic&quot; (a very 
				minimal set of items). </li>
				<li>If you are not Unicode member organization go to <strong>My 
				Options</strong>, and set your coverage level explicitly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2><strong>Country-Specific Information</strong></h2>
			<p>Once you&#39;ve looked over all the sections in your language, you 
			should go back to the <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey">
			Locale</a> window, and scroll back to your language. You&#39;ll see 
			different countries there on the right side of your language. If 
			there are locale variations in the use of your language, according 
			to country, then you can change them now. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>You <em>only</em> need to do this for differences; 
				otherwise, the data is &quot;inherited&quot; from the language. </li>
				<li>For example, the common grouping (thousands) separator in 
				the language may be &#39;, as in <em>3&#39;456,78</em>, but in a 
				particular country it could be a space, as in <em>3&nbsp;456,78</em>. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Resolving Differences among Translators</h2>
			<p>After the data submission phase, any differences in the submitted data will be 
			resolved according to the
			<a href="process.html#resolution_procedure">data resolution process</a>.</p>
			<h2>Problems?</h2>The tool has undergone substantial revisions based on feedback we 
			received during the last release. There are still some rough edges 
			and we ask for your patience with problems that occur. In 
			particular, the tool is not designed to handle a large number of 
			people working at the same time, so if it appears unresponsive, 
			please try again later on (and save your work as you go).<p>If you 
			find a problem, you may want to review
			<a class="wikipagelink" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/wiki?SurveyToolDev/KnownBugs">KnownBugs</a> to see whether it has already been reported (and 
			whether there is a work-around). If not, or if you have suggestions 
			for improvements, please file a bug using the Feedback link at the 
			bottom of each window.</p>
