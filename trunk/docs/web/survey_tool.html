					<h1>Unicode CLDR Survey Tool</h1>
					<p>Most data in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository is gathered and processed via what is called the Survey Tool, an online 
					tool that can be used to view data for different languages and propose additions or changes.
			<wbr>This tool has been substantially enhanced for the current release, with a forum has been added to allow communication between translators.</wbr></p>
					<wbr>
					<p>During the current data submission period, contributors from Unicode Consortium members, other organizations and the public at large are 
					invited to review the data for their languages and countries, and propose new translations of terms or modifications, including language translations 
					entirely new to the repository. In this release, new structure has been added to the repository to improve representation of time zones, ranges 
					of dates and the usage of languages. For the release schedule, see
				<a href="index.html">CLDR Project</a>.</p>
					<h2>Accounts</h2>
					<p>You don’t need an account to view data for a particular language. If you wish to propose changes or additions, you will need an account: 
					see <a class="wikipagelink" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/wiki?SurveyToolAccounts">Survey Tool Accounts</a>.</p>
					<h2>Locale List</h2>
					The main screen of the survey tool is located at <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey">http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey</a>. It displays 
					a list of languages currently available. Languages will vary by script (Arabic vs. Latin, or Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese), and occasionally 
					by country. For historic reasons, this combination of language with script or country is known as a <i>locale</i>.<p>For each language, the 
					content is what is appropriate for the most populous country, thus the content for <i>English</i> [en] is whatever is appropriate for the United 
					States. Any variation by country for that language will be represented in a country locale: thus content appropriate for the Australia that 
					differs from what is in <i>English</i> [en] will be in a the sublocale <i>English (Australia) </i>[en_AU].</p>
					<p>Click on the languages (optionally countries) which you would like to view. You can always get back to this page by clicking on <em>Locales</em> 
					at the top left of the page. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you have permission to modify a locale, after the locale you will see the
						<img alt="The image “http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/hand.png” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/hand.png" /> 
						symbol. </li>
						<li>If you would like to add data for a <em>new</em> locale, please notify your CLDR contact (see
						<a class="wikipagelink" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/wiki?SurveyToolAccounts">Survey Tool Accounts</a>). He or she can add an empty 
						locale which can then have data added into it.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Reviewing and Submitting Data</h2>
					There is a key explaining the way the windows are laid out at <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/data/docs/survey/windows.html">Survey Tool Windows</a>. 
					You should review this before starting. You will then start going through each section: <i>languages</i>, <i>scripts</i>, <i>territories</i>, 
					... all the way to <i>supplemental</i>.<ul>
						<li>As you go through the sections, you will generally review the Priority items (if any), and fix or add translations.
						<ul>
							<li>Click on the right option, if it is there. </li>
							<li>Otherwise click on &quot;<i>change to</i>&quot;, then type in the fixed or new text.</li>
							<li><em><b>Important</b>:</em> before you leave any page, click on the <b>Save</b> button to save your changes. It&#39;s also a good idea 
							to do this if you are spending a lot of time on a page, just in case there is a problem.</li>
							<li>Control-F to find something on the page is really useful in moving around on these pages, as are Page up and Page down keys. You 
							can also switch between ordering items by <b>Priority</b> vs <b>Code</b>.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>More information is in the &quot;Zoomed&quot; view, so be sure to look at that if you have any questions. It&#39;s also a good idea to zoom in on 
						at least one item in each section, to review any information for that section.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The locale data should be in the customary form for the target language, in the form that is in most common usage. For example, for the territory 
					name in English one would use &quot;Switzerland&quot; instead of &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot;, and use &quot;United Kingdom&quot; instead of &quot;The United Kingdom of Great 
					Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
					<h2><strong>Coverage</strong></h2>
					<p>The warnings about missing items are based on your <i>coverage level.</i> </p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you are from a Unicode member organization, your default coverage level will be set for you. This will flag a number of items for 
						your translation using alert icons, from &quot;comprehensive&quot; (all possible items) down to &quot;basic&quot; (a very minimal set of items). </li>
						<li>If you are not Unicode member organization go to <strong>My Options</strong>, and set your coverage level explicitly.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><strong>Country-Specific Information</strong></h2>
					<p>The language locale should contain the most broadly used data for that language, and should be appropriate for the most populous region; 
					other specific region locales should only contain data where they need to override individual items, when the &quot;inherited&quot; language locale data 
					would not be customary in that region.</p>
					<p>Once you&#39;ve looked over all the sections in your language, you should go back to the <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey">Locale</a> 
					window, and scroll back to your language. You&#39;ll see different countries there on the right side of your language. If there are locale variations 
					in the use of your language, according to country, then you can change them now. You <em>only</em> need to do this for cases where the usage 
					in the countries differ from the main language. </p>
					<h3><font color="#AA0000"><strong>Default Content</strong></font></h3>
					<p>In past releases, sometimes translations were entered into the main language locale (like zh), and sometimes into various children (zh-Hans 
					or zh-Hans-CN). Because of that, we sometimes ended up with inconsistencies between content that should have been the same. In this version, 
					we are enforcing the rule that each language locale has consistent content appropriate for the most populous country locale. In preparing for 
					this, data has been moved, sometimes exposing conflicting content, and needs to be resolved by translators. So please review all cases of conflicts, 
					and choose the most appropriate item.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In some cases, this may involve copying an item to a country or script locale. For example, there might be a traditional Chinese string 
						in zh, when it should be in zh-Hant.</li>
						<li>Known instances of conflicts are marked internally with &quot;x999&quot;; these will have warning icons:
						<a target="_blank" title="zoom" href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey?_=fr&forum=fr&xpath=28">
						<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" src="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/warn.png" title="Warning: push zoom to see details" border="0" /></a></li>
						<li>Cases where a country locale was inheriting from root (such as inheriting a raw country code) will also be flagged.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><a name="Special_Considerations">Special Considerations</a></h2>
					<h3><span><a name="Character_Repertoire">Character Repertoire</a></span></h3>
					<p><span>The data in the locale repository should contain the most appropriate choice of characters for the representation of the text. It may 
					thus include Unicode characters that are not included in a given legacy character set. In particular, the data may contain curly quotes and 
					apostrophes (such as in “can’t”), and similar characters such as the letter modifiers in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi.</span></p>
					<p><span>These characters provide more distinctions than are available with the generic ASCII repertoire. They may be “downcast” to the best 
					available characters when the data is imported into systems with a more limited repertoire of supported characters. (Downcasting information 
					is provided with <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/character_fallback_substitutions.html">character fallback substitutions</a>.)</span></p>
					<h3><span>Hong Kong, Macau</span></h3>
					<p><span>The territory codes HK and MO are to be translated with the native equivalent of “Hong Kong SAR China” and “Macao SAR China”, respectively. 
					SAR stands for “Special Administrative Region” and can be represented with acronym in the target language. There are alternative, short versions 
					of these that should also be translated; those omit the &quot;SAR China&quot;.</span></p>
					<h2>Resolving Differences among Translators</h2>
					<p>After the data submission phase, any differences in the submitted data will be resolved according to the
					<a href="process.html#resolution_procedure">data resolution process</a>.</p>
					<h2>Problems?</h2>
					The tool has undergone substantial revisions based on feedback we received during the last release. There are still some rough edges and we 
					ask for your patience with problems that occur. In particular, the tool is not designed to handle a large number of people working at the same 
					time, so if it appears unresponsive, please try again later on (and save your work as you go).<p>If you find a problem, you may want to review
					<a class="wikipagelink" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/wiki?SurveyToolDev/KnownBugs">KnownBugs</a> to see whether it has already been reported 
					(and whether there is a work-around). If not, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please file a bug using the Feedback link at the 
					bottom of each window.</p>
