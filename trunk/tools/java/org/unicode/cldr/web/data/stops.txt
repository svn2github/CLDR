** 1. Overview of administrative interface

I. Login access

  You can log in as the Administrator account with the email address
'admin@' and the password specified in the CLDR_VAP parameter in the
cldr.properties file.
  When logged in, you will see a red bar at the top of the page that says:
    'Be careful, you are an administrator!'
  This is here to warn you that some normal user safeguards are not in place,
and also that you have access to advanced functions.   Also, it reminds you that
your votes have 'override' capability.

II. Administrative override

  As the administrative account has override capability, it is possible to break ties.
