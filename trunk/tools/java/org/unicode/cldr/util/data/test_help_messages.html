		<p>Languages, scripts (writing systems), territories (countries and regions), currencies, and time zones are represented in computers by internal codes, 
		such as &quot;<code>fr</code>&quot; for the French language or &quot;<code>CA</code>&quot; for the country of Canada.</p>
		<p>You should supply the most customary name used in your language, even if it is not the official name. For example, for the territory name in English 
		you would use &quot;Switzerland&quot; instead of &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot;, and use &quot;United Kingdom&quot; instead of &quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. 
		All names must be unique within a given category: thus one cannot use the same translated name for the following two codes; only one can be called &quot;Congo&quot;:</p>

		<h3>Territories</h3>
		<p>Territories include both country names and regions: continents and subcontinents (defined by a UN standard). All of these must be unique: for example, 
		you can&#39;t give the same name to the country <i>South Africa</i> (the country) and to <i>Southern Africa</i> (the southern region of the continent of Africa), 
		even though there may be no distinction in your language between the terms for &quot;<i>South</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Southern</i>&quot;. Similarly, <i>North America</i> is 
		the continent that extends down to Panama; <i>Northern America</i> is the region of the Americas north of Mexico.</p>
		<p>The country name should be the most natural; you may have to adjust the name of the region. So you might say the equivalent of &quot;South Region of Africa&quot;, 
		or add clarifying language like &quot;<span class="loser"><i>Amérique du Nord continentale</i>&quot; vs &quot;<i>Amérique du Nord</i>&quot;. If you have any question as to 
		the extent of any region, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/territory_containment_un_m_49.html">Territory Containment</a>.

		<h3>Languages</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of languages here (around 500), and you <em>don&#39;t</em> need to look at them all! Many are relatively obscure, and not worth translating 
		in a first path. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A common question is whether to capitalize or not. With a new locale, use whatever is normal practice for what should occur in menus. For an existing 
			locale, follow what is used for the other items already translated. This is good practice for territories and other types of items too.</li>
			<li>If the capitalization convention as a whole for a language needs to be changed, that should be done before the data submission phase for a 
			release. Please file a bug to request that this be done.</li>
			<li><i>Do not use terms that imply exclusion. For example, do not translate &quot;Athapascan Languages&quot; as if it were &quot;Other Athapascan Languages&quot;.</i></li>

		<h3>Complex Language Codes</h3>
		<p>Some language codes are more complex, of the form &quot;en_AU&quot; for <i>Australian English</i>. If you don&#39;t add a translation, then those will be represented 
		by a format like &quot;αγγλικά (Αυστραλία)&quot;. That is, the translation would be the native name for &quot;English&quot;, followed by the native word for &quot;Australia&quot; in 
		parentheses. If that format is ok, then you don&#39;t need to translate the more complex language code. The codes zh_Hant and zh_Hans (for Traditional and Simplified 
		Chinese) on the other hand, should always be translated. </p>
		<p>There are a few special cases: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;Iberian Portuguese&quot; is the style of Portuguese used in Portugal (as opposed to Brazil)</li>
			<li>Similarly &quot;Iberian Spanish&quot; is the style of Spanish used in Spain (as opposed to Latin America).</li>
			<li>&quot;Swiss High German&quot; (<i>Schweizer Hochdeutsch</i>), also called &quot;Swiss Standard German&quot;, has the code <code>de_CH</code>.</li>
			<li>&quot;Swiss German&quot; (<i>Schwyzerdütsch</i>) has the code <code>gsw</code>.</li>

		<ul>

		<td>//ldml/characters/exemplarCharacters.*</td>

		<h3>Exemplar Character Set</h3>
		<p>The exemplar character set contains the commonly used letters for a given modern form of a language. These are used for testing and for determining the 
		appropriate repertoire of letters for charset conversion or text comparison. The term &quot;letter&quot; is interpreted broadly, and includes characters used to form 
		words, such as 是 or 가. If a sequence of characters is considered a &quot;letter&quot;, it will be listed between { and }. For example, <em>{ch}</em>.</p>
		<p>There are three categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <i>standard</i> characters are those used in customary writing, such as [a-z] for English.</li>
			<li>The <i>auxiliary</i> characters are additional characters used in foreign words found in typical magazines, newspapers, &amp;c. For example, you could 
			see the name Schröder in English in a magazine, so <i>ö</i> is in the set. However, it is very uncommon to see <i>ł</i>, so that isn&#39;t in the auxiliary 
			set for English. Publication style guides, such as <i>The Economist Style Guide</i> for English, are useful for this.</li>
			<li>The <i>currency</i> characters are additional characters used in currency symbols, like &#39;US$ 1,234&#39;.</li>
		</ul>
		The exemplar set is not a complete set of letters used for a language: punctuation and other symbols are not included, nor uppercase letters (except for 
		Turkish İ). The Survey Tool will flag certain fields with
		<img alt="The image “http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/warn.png” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/warn.png" /> 
		if they use characters that are not in exemplar sets. In some cases, this is not truly an error, such as where &quot;NaN&quot; is used in numbers. In other cases, 
		the possible actions for you are are:
		<ul>
			<li>Fix the field value to not use the character.</li>
			<li>Fix the exemplar sets, because the character actually is acceptable in your language in one of the above categories.</li>
		</ul>
		<p align="left">Any range of characters, such as &quot;a b c d e&quot; can be represented compactly as &quot;a-e&quot;. For more information, please see <i>
		<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-6.html#Character_Elements">Section 5.6 Character Elements</a></i> in <i>UTS#35: Locale Data Markup Language

		<p align="left">For example, the pattern &quot;#,###.00&quot; when used to format the number 12345.678 could result in &quot;12&#39;345,67&quot;. That would happen if the grouping 
		separator for your language is an apostrophe, and the decimal separator is a comma. Translators should not change the pattern of zeros (0) or hash marks 
		(#); those will be reset by software. This is true also for currency formats. Even if your currency doesn&#39;t use any decimal points, the currency format 
		will have them in the pattern. You need to modify the patterns when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The grouping separator is not by thousands (eg Hindi). </li>
			<li>The negative pattern doesn&#39;t simply add a minus sign. For example, if a negative number is formed by adding parentheses, then this would look like: 
			#,##0.###;(#,##0.###). That is, the negative form gets added after a semicolon.</li>

		<p align="left">In the standard used for time zones, a <i>time zone</i> is an area of a country that has consistent behavior in terms of its offset from 
		Greenwich Mean Time. In particular, within that zone, the same daylight-savings (summer-time) behavior is observed, now and in the past and future (as far 
		as is known). This means that time zones are fairly fine granularity, as you can see by consulting <span class="loser">
		<a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/territory_containment_un_m_49.html">Territory Containment</a>. </span>The name of the time

		<h3>Time Zone Exemplar Cities</h3>
		<p>For generic references to time zones, the country is used if possible, composed with a pattern that in English appears as &quot;{0} Time&quot;. Thus a time zone 
		may appear as &quot;Bolivia Time&quot;. If the country has multiple time zones, then a city is used to distinguish which one, thus &quot;Argentina (La Rioja) Time&quot;. Thus 
		for basic coverage, cities thus only need to be translated if they are in a country with multiple time zones.</p>

		<h3>Metazones</h3>
		<p>For some time zones, the survey tool will state that a particular <i>metazone</i> is in effect. A metazone is simply a grouping of time zones that share 
		a common display name in customary usage. For example, <code>Europe/Paris</code>, <code>Europe/Berlin</code>, and many other time zones share a common display 
		name &quot;Central European Time&quot;, and have a common metazone <code>Europe_Central</code>. Use of a metazone allows us to translate this text only once while 
		it can be use in many different time zones. The survey tool will show the default mappings for when a particular metazone was in use for a particular time 
		zone. If you believe the mappings to be incorrect for your locality, please use the link to record any desired changes to the metazone mappings. Metazones 
		have the same display fields as regular time zones, except that they have no exemplar city associated with them. </p>
		<p>Often there are situations where a particular time zone has an abbreviation, but the abbreviation is so seldom used that most people would not recognize 
		it. The &quot;commonlyUsed&quot; field for a metazone is used to indicate that abbreviations for a particular time zone or metazone are in common use in the locale. 
		You have two choices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the GMT format would be understood better, set commonlyUsed to &quot;false&quot;</li>
			<li>Otherwise, if the abbriviation is commonly understood, set commonlyUsed&nbsp; to &quot;true&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example: In English, PST is a commonly used abbreviation for &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;, for the metazone<code> </code><code>America_Pacific</code>. 
		While NPT is an abbreviation for &quot;Nepal Time&quot;, most English speakers would not recognize the meaning of &quot;2:00 PM NPT&quot;. Thus, commonlyUsed should be <i>true</i> 
		for <code>America_Pacific</code> (displaying, for example, 2:00 PM PST) and <i>false</i> for <code>Asia/Katmandu</code> (displaying, for example, &quot;4:00 
		GMT+05:45&quot;).</p>

		be &quot;lowercase-words&quot;. The values are:</p>

		would normally have grammatical adjustments depending on what the name of the city is. For example, one might have &quot;12:43 pm <u>Tempo d&#39;</u>Australia&quot; but 
		&quot;12:43 pm <u>Tempo de </u>Paris&quot;. In that case, it might be better to either omit the phrasing and just have &quot;12:43 pm Australia&quot; and &quot;12:43 pm Paris&quot;, 
		or to use a &quot;form&quot; style phrasing, like &quot;12:43 pm <u>Tempo de: </u>Australia&quot; and &quot;12:43 pm <u>Tempo de: </u>Paris&quot;.</p>

		that aren&#39;t translated. The codes you need to use are <a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey?p_codes=t">locale codes</a>, not the
