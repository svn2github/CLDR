		includes characters used to form words, such as 是 or 가. If a sequence of 
		characters is considered a &quot;letter&quot;, it will be listed between { and }. 
		For example, <em>{ch}</em>.<p>There are three categories:</p>

			<li>The <i>standard</i> characters are those used in customary 
			writing, such as [a-z] for English.</li>
			<li>The <i>auxiliary</i> characters are additional characters used 
			in foreign words found in typical magazines, newspapers, &amp;c. For 
			example, you could see the name Schröder in English in a magazine, 
			so <i>ö</i> is in the set. However, it is very uncommon to see <i>ł</i>, 
			so that isn&#39;t in the auxiliary set for English. Publication style 
			guides, such as <i>The Economist Style Guide</i> for English, are

		if they use characters that are not in exemplar sets. In some cases, 
		this is not truly an error, such as where &quot;NaN&quot; is used in numbers. In 
		other cases, the possible actions for you are are:
		<ul>
			<li>Fix the field value to not use the character.</li>
			<li>Fix the exemplar sets, because the character actually is 
			acceptable in your language in one of the above categories.</li>

		have the same display fields as regular time zones, except that they 
		have no exemplar city associated with them.
		<p>Often there are situations where a particular timezone has an 
		abbreviation, but the abbreviation is so seldom used that most people 
		would not recognize it. The &quot;commonlyUsed&quot; field for a metazone is used 
		to indicate that abbreviations for a particular timezone or metazone are 
		in common use in the locale. You have two choices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the GMT format would be understood better, set commonlyUsed 
			to &quot;false&quot;</li>
			<li>Otherwise, if the abbriviation is commonly understood, set 
			commonlyUsed&nbsp; to &quot;true&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example: In English, PST is a commonly used abbreviation for 
		&quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;, for the metazone<code> </code><code>
		America_Pacific</code>. While NPT is an abbreviation for &quot;Nepal Time&quot;, 
		most English speakers would not recognize the meaning of &quot;2:00 PM NPT&quot;. 
		Thus, commonlyUsed should be <i>true</i> for <code>America_Pacific</code> 
		(displaying, for example, 2:00 PM PST) and <i>false</i> for <code>
		Asia/Katmandu</code> (displaying, for example, &quot;4:00 GMT+05:45&quot;).</td>

		This is whatever should count for &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot; in your language. Don&#39;t

		<td>//ldml/layout/in(List|Text).*</td>
		<td>
		This should be one of the words uppercase, titlecase, lowercase, or 
		mixed. For example, if your language usually has the names of countries 
		in lowercase, then set the value for territories to be &quot;lowercase&quot;. This 
		will cause country names that are not in lowercase to be flagged for 
		special consideration.</td>

		This field controls the format for the time used with the GMT. So to get

<p>The software that reads this table will search the first column (eg between 
&lt;td&gt; and &lt;/td&gt;) and return the contents of the second column. I plan on adding a 
few variables also, for the current locale name, in particular. This file uses 
the survey tool style-sheet, so you can use those <span  class="winner">styles</span> 
(and icons, like
<a target="target=" surveytool:n:de class="forumlink" href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey?_=de&forum=de&xpath=249">
