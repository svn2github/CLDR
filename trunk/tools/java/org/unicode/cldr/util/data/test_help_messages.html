		to form words, such as 是 or 가. If a sequence of characters is considered a &quot;letter&quot;, it will be listed between { and }. For example, <em>{ch}</em>.<p>There 
		are three categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <i>standard</i> characters are those used in customary writing, such as [a-z] for English.</li>
			<li>The <i>auxiliary</i> characters are additional characters used in foreign words found in typical magazines, newspapers, &amp;c. For example, you could 
			see the name Schröder in English in a magazine, so <i>ö</i> is in the set. However, it is very uncommon to see <i>ł</i>, so that isn&#39;t in the auxiliary 
			set for English. Publication style guides, such as <i>The Economist Style Guide</i> for English, are useful for this.</li>
			<li>The <i>currency</i> characters are additional characters used in currency symbols, like &#39;US$ 1,234&#39;.</li>
		</ul>
		The exemplar set is not a complete set of letters used for a language: punctuation and other symbols are not included, nor uppercase letters (except for

		if they use characters that are not in exemplar sets. In some cases, this is not truly an error, such as where &quot;NaN&quot; is used in numbers. In other cases, 
		the possible actions for you are are:
		<ul>
			<li>Fix the field value to not use the character.</li>
			<li>Fix the exemplar sets, because the character actually is acceptable in your language in one of the above categories.</li>

		(#); those will be reset by software. This is true also for currency formats. Even if your currency doesn&#39;t use any decimal points, the currency format 
		will have them in the pattern. You need to modify the patterns when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The grouping separator is not by thousands (eg Hindi). </li>
			<li>The negative pattern doesn&#39;t simply add a minus sign. For example, if a negative number is formed by adding parentheses, then this would look like:

			Time), daylight (Pacific Daylight Time), plus abbreviations of those.<i><b> You only want to provide names (and especially abbreviations) where those

		<td>For generic references to time zones, the country is used if possible, composed with a pattern that in English appears as &quot;{0} Time&quot;. Thus a time zone 
		may appear as &quot;Bolivia Time&quot;. If the country has multiple time zones, then a city is used to distinguish which one, thus &quot;Argentina (La Rioja) Time&quot;. Thus 
		for basic coverage, cities thus only need to be translated if they are in a country with multiple time zones.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.*/(usesM|m)etazone.*</td>
		<td>For some time zones, the survey tool will state that a particular <i>metazone</i> is in effect. A metazone is simply a grouping of time zones that share 
		a common display name in customary usage. For example, <code>Europe/Paris</code>, <code>Europe/Berlin</code>, and many other time zones share a common display 
		name &quot;Central European Time&quot;, and have a common metazone <code>Europe_Central</code>. Use of a metazone allows us to translate this text only once while 
		it can be use in many different time zones. The survey tool will show the default mappings for when a particular metazone was in use for a particular time 
		zone. If you believe the mappings to be incorrect for your locality, please use the link to record any desired changes to the metazone mappings. Metazones 
		have the same display fields as regular time zones, except that they have no exemplar city associated with them.
		<p>Often there are situations where a particular time zone has an abbreviation, but the abbreviation is so seldom used that most people would not recognize 
		it. The &quot;commonlyUsed&quot; field for a metazone is used to indicate that abbreviations for a particular time zone or metazone are in common use in the locale. 
		You have two choices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the GMT format would be understood better, set commonlyUsed to &quot;false&quot;</li>
			<li>Otherwise, if the abbriviation is commonly understood, set commonlyUsed&nbsp; to &quot;true&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example: In English, PST is a commonly used abbreviation for &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;, for the metazone<code> </code><code>America_Pacific</code>. 
		While NPT is an abbreviation for &quot;Nepal Time&quot;, most English speakers would not recognize the meaning of &quot;2:00 PM NPT&quot;. Thus, commonlyUsed should be <i>true</i> 
		for <code>America_Pacific</code> (displaying, for example, 2:00 PM PST) and <i>false</i> for <code>Asia/Katmandu</code> (displaying, for example, &quot;4:00 
		GMT+05:45&quot;).</p>
