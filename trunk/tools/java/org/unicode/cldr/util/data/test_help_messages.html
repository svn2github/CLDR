<body>

<p>This is a help-text file for use with the survey tool. The software that 
interprets this expects a particular format, so don't make arbitrary changes. 
You can add a new row, where the Key is usually a regex for a path, and you can 
put text to insert. The text to insert can actually be fairly arbitrary HTML.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000080" style="border-collapse: collapse">
	<tr>
		<th>Path</th>
		<th>Text to insert</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.*/exemplarCharacters.*</td>
		<td>The standard exemplar characters are those used in customary writing 
		([a-z] for English; the auxiliary characters are used in foreign words 
		found in typical magazines, newspapers, &amp;c.; currency auxiliary 
		characters are those used in currency symbols, like 'US$ 1,234'.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>.*/numbers.*/pattern.*</td>
		<td>You need to use '.' for the decimal point and ',' for the thousands 
		(grouping) separator, even if they are not used in your language. They 
		are special characters that will be replaced by your real decimal point 
		and thousands separator (see the number symbols for those).</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The software that reads this table will search the first column (eg between 
&lt;td&gt; and &lt;/td&gt;) and return the contents of the second column. I plan on adding a 
few variables also, for the current locale name, in particular. </p>
<p><b>WARNING</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b><i>It uses a very dumb parser, so make sure that &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;/tr&gt; are on 
	separate lines!</i></b></li>
	<li><b><i>The regex must match the whole path, so if it is an interior 
	substring, remember to add .* on both ends.</i></b></li>
</ul>
