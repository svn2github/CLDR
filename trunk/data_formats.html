<h1 align="center">Data Formats</h1>
<p>This document provides basic information about data formats for fields in the
Common Locale Data Repository. It is intended to clarify the meaning of some of
the data in the CLDR for localizers and other people reading the CLDR comparison
charts.</p>
<p>The formats are described in the LDML <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm">specification</a>;
in addition, there is a link at the top of the page to the ICU locale explorer,
where the results of different formats can be viewed. Note that some fields are
expected to be in English, since they indicate internal IDs and <i>not</i>
translated text, such as the layout orientation, which has the value
&quot;top-to-bottom&quot;.</p>
<p>This document is fairly rough at this point, and needs quite a bit of work.
However, we felt it worth posting to help answer common questions about the
format.</p>
<h2>Regions, Languages, Scripts, Currency Names</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These items are perhaps the simplest to translate. The typically behavior
  if any particular one is not available is to display the corresponding ISO
  code (or RFC 3066 code). Thus if there is no localization of FR (France), then
  the string &quot;FR&quot; will appear.</p>
  <p>For a list of the kinds of IDs that can be localized, see the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/all_diff_xml/en_US.html">English-US
  locale data</a>, which has most regions, languages, scripts and currency names
  translated. For the possible timezone IDs that can be translated, see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/olson_ids.txt">Olson
  IDs</a>.</p>
  <p>Because these lists are long, it may be more difficult to collect all the
  data at once. If that is the case, we suggest first providing translations of
  at least the elements that are most familiar to people with the target
  language. This might be, for example, the countries, languages, scripts, and
  (modern) currencies for:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Countries having the target language as an official language</li>
    <li>G7 + BRIC countries: US, Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy;
      Brazil, Russia, India, China</li>
    <li>Countries adjacent to the countries in #1</li>
  </ol>

<h2><a name="CurrencyElements">Currency Elements</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These strings are used in parsing/formatting numbers which are designated
  as currency values.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Currency Symbol</b>
  <dd>This is used whenever a 'currency symbol' (\u00A4) is encountered in a
    currency number pattern.
  <dt><b>Int'l Currency Symbol</b>
  <dd>Three-letter international code for a currency. Used where a doubled
    currency symbol (\u00A4 \u00A4) is encountered in a number pattern.
  <dt><b>Currency separator</b>
  <dd>This is used as the decimal separator in currency formatting/parsing,
    instead of the DecimalSeparator from the <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a>
    list.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="DateTimeElements">Date &amp; Time Options</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>First day of the week</b>
  <dd>A number indicating which day of the week is considered the 'first' day,
    for calendar purposes. It is 1-based, with 1 being Sunday, 2 being Monday,
    .. 7 being Saturday.
  <dt><b>Minimal Days in First Week</b>
  <dd>Minimal days required in the first week of a month or year. For example,
    if the first week is defined as one that contains the first day of the first
    month of a year, this value will be 1. If it must be a full seven days
    before it counts as the first week, then the value would be 7.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="DateTimePatterns">Date &amp; Time Patterns</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first 8 items are different lengths of either date or time patterns.
  See the <a href="#localPatternChars">localPatternChars</a> (in the locale) for
  the meanings of special characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Quoting rules</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Single quotes, (<b>'</b>), enclose bits of the pattern that should be
  treated literally. Inside a quoted string, two single quotes ('') are replaced
  with a single one ('). For example: <tt><u>'class of '</u>YYYY<u>' at '</u>h<u>'
  o''clock'</u></tt> -&gt; <b>class of 1939 at 6 o'clock</b> (Literal strings <u>underlined</u>.)</p>

</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Decimal Separator</b>
  <dd>- separates the integer and fractional part of the number.
  <dt><b>Grouping Separator</b>
  <dd>- groups (for example) units of thousands: 10^6 = 1,000,000. The grouping
    separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some countries for
    ten-thousands. The interval is a constant number of digits between the
    grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000. If you supply a
    pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval between the last one
    and the end of the integer is the one that is used. So
    &quot;#,##,###,####&quot; == &quot;######,####&quot; ==
    &quot;##,####,####&quot;.
  <dt><b>Pattern Separator</b>
  <dd>- sets the character used for separating variant expressions. (For
    example: <u>0.00<b>;</b>(0.00)</u> where the second pattern is the form to
    use for negative number)
  <dt><b>Percent</b>
  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount. (If present, the
    value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 123%)
  <dt><b>ZeroDigit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that place
    would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0', the pattern
    &quot;000&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as &quot;034&quot;, but the
    pattern &quot;0&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as just &quot;34&quot;. As
    well, the digits 1-9 are expected to follow the code point of this specified
    0 value.
  <dt><b>Digit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate any digit value. If that digit is zero, then it
    is not shown.
  <dt><b>Minus Sign</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.
  <dt><b>Exponential</b>
  <dd>- Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.
  <dt><b>PerMill</b>
  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a per-mille (1/1000th) amount. (If present, the
    value is also multiplied by 1000 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 1230
    [1/000])
  <dt><b>Infinity</b>
  <dd>- The infinity sign. Corresponds to the IEEE infinity bit pattern.
  <dt><b>Not a number</b>
  <dd>- The NaN sign. Corresponds to the IEEE NaN bit pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="NumberPatterns">Number Patterns</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Patterns for formatting different types of numbers. Note that the <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a>
  resource affects how these patterns are interpreted.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Decimal</b>
  <dd>The normal locale specific way to write a base 10 number.
  <dt><b>Currency</b>
  <dd>Use \u00A4 where the local currency symbol should be. Doubling the
    currency symbol (\u00A4\u00A4) will output the international currency symbol
    (a 3-letter code).
  <dt><b>Percent</b>
  <dd>Pattern for use with percentage formatting
  <dt><b>Scientific</b>
  <dd>Pattern for use with scientific (exponent) formatting.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Quoting rules:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Single quotes, (<b>'</b>), enclose bits of the pattern that should be
  treated literally. Inside a quoted string, two single quotes ('') are replaced
  with a single one ('). For example: <tt><u>'X '</u>#<u>' at '</u>h<u>'
  o''clock'</u></tt> -&gt; <b>class of 1939 at 6 o'clock</b> (Literal strings <u>underlined</u>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Time Zones</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A time zone uses the Olson IDs, such as America/Los Angeles. These IDs
  provide not only the information as to the offset from GMT (UTC), but also the
  daylight savings information. Thus, for example, America/Phoenix is distinct
  from America/Denver because they have different daylight savings time
  behavior. There are many cases where there is no modern difference between two
  IDs; they are only distinguished in the past. For example, XXX/YYY and ZZZ/WWW
  are currently the same, but differed in the past.</p>
  <p>Most countries do not span multiple time zones, and may not have localized
  names for particular time zones. In that case, probably the best localizations
  are something of a form like &quot;New York Time&quot;.</p>
  <p>Localized names for time zones. The fields are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display long name for the normal time zone.
    <li>Abbreviation for the normal time zone.
    <li>Display long name for the time zone on summer/daylight savings time.
    <li>Abbreviation for the time zone on summer/daylight savings time.
    <li>A city in the specified time zone.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>AM / PM</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even for countries where the customary date format only has a 24 hour
  format, both the am and pm localized strings must be present and must be
  distinct from one another. However, if the 24 hour format is used, these
  strings will normally never be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="localPatternChars">Localized Date Pattern Chars</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These characters are replaced with the appropriate values when a date or
  time is being formatted.</p>
  <p>Characters may be used multiple times. For example, if y is used for the
  year, 'yy' might produce '99', whereas 'yyyy' produces '1999'.</p>
  <p>For most numerical characters, the number of characters specifies the field
  width. For example, if h is the hour, 'h' might produce '5', but 'hh' produces
  '05'. For some characters, the count specifies whether an abbreviated or full
  form should be used.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> In the following list, the default (English) form is used as
  an example, but see the actual locale for the correct characters!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><tt>G</tt> Era - Replaced with the <a href="#Era">Era</a> string for the
    current date.
  <li><tt>y</tt> Year - Use two for the short year, or 4 for the full year
  <li><tt>M</tt> Month - Use one or two for the numerical month, three for the
    abbreviation, or four for the full name.
  <li><tt>d</tt> Date - Day of the month. Use one, or two for zero padding.
  <li><tt>k</tt> Hour of day 1 [Midnight appears as '24']
  <li><tt>H</tt> Hour of day 0 [0-23]
  <li><tt>m</tt> Minute - Use one or two
  <li><tt>s</tt> Second - use one or two
  <li><tt>S</tt> Millisecond - Use 1,2, or 3.. shows the MOST significant
    digits.
  <li><tt>E</tt> Day of week - Use three for the short day, or four for the full
    name.
  <li><tt>D</tt> Day of year - Use 1-3
  <li><tt>F</tt> Day of Week in Month- use one. This is 1 for the first day of
    the week, etc..
  <li><tt>w</tt> Week of Year - use 1 or 2.
    <ul>
      <font size="-1">&quot;Values calculated for the WEEK_OF_YEAR field range
      from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a year is the first week that contains at least
      getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() days from that year. It depends on the values
      of getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(), getFirstDayOfWeek(), and the day of the
      week of January 1. Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the
      following year are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed).
      For example, January 1, 1998 was a Thursday. If getFirstDayOfWeek() is
      MONDAY and getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4 (these are the values
      reflecting ISO 8601 and many national standards), then week 1 of 1998
      starts on December 29, 1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. However, if
      getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4,
      1998, and ends on January 10, 1998. The first three days of 1998 are then
      part of week 53 of 1997.&quot; (from <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/dateCalendar.html#cal">ICU

  <li><tt>A</tt> Year (of &quot;Week of Year&quot;). [May differ from Calendar
    year, see comments under 'Week of Year', above.]
  <li><tt>e</tt> Timezone. Use 3 for the short timezone (i.e. PST) or 4 for the

<h3>BIDI Ordering</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the comparison charts, the ordering of characters for BIDI languages is
  up to the browser. The ordering may differ from the typical ordering in
  context, so may be helpful to copy the text from the charts and paste into
  typical environments to ensure that the ordering is correct. This is
  especially the case for date, time and number formats.</p>
