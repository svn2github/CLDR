<p>This document provides basic information about data formats for fields in the
Common Locale Data Repository. It is intended to clarify the meaning of some of
the data in the CLDR for localizers and other people reading the CLDR comparison
charts.</p>
<p>The formats are described in the LDML <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm">specification</a>;
in addition, there is a link at the top of the page to the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">ICU
locale explorer</a>, where the results of different formats can be viewed. Note
that some fields are expected to be in English, since they indicate internal IDs
and <i>not</i> translated text, such as the layout orientation, which has the
value &quot;top-to-bottom&quot;.</p>
<p>This document is fairly rough at this point, and needs quite a bit of work.
However, we felt it worth posting to help answer common questions about the
format.</p>
<h2><a name="Collation">Collation</a> (Sorting Sequence)</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The exact collation sequence for a given language may be difficult to
  determine. The base ordering of characters can be fairly straightforward, but
  there are quite a few other complications involved. For more information, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Introduction">UTS
  #10: Unicode Collation Algorithm</a> (UCA).</p>
  <p>For readability, the rules are presented here in Java/ICU rule format,
  rather than XML. The rules are gathered programmatically; gathering the data
  for the rules is complicated by a number of factors, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Different data sources use a different &quot;base&quot; for tailoring
      (the Common rules use the UCA as a base).</li>
    <li>Sometimes special features are handled programmatically, such as having
      an SHADDA mark apply to all Unicode characters instead of just Arabic
      letters.</li>
    <li>Sometimes characters out of the repertoire are simply ignored, thus
      having a<font size="3">&#380; &lt; ab, since &#380; (z with over-dot) is
      ignored.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Sometimes orderings will not abide by the UCA
      well-formedness criteria, so there may be cases where for characters X and
      Y, X &lt; Y, XY and YX are not contractions, but XY = YX.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p>At the moment there are a number of known problems with the gathering
  mechanism that may result in spurious rules. For more information, see <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/locale-bugs/public?findid=18">known
  errors and omissions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Display Names for Languages, Scripts, Territories, Currencies, Time Zones</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These items are perhaps the simplest to translate. The typically behavior
  if any particular one is not available is to display the corresponding ISO
  code (or RFC 3166 code). Thus if there is no localization of FR (France), then
  the string &quot;FR&quot; will appear.</p>
  <p>For a list of the kinds of IDs that can be localized, see the <a href="all_diff_xml/en_US.html">English-US
  locale data</a>, which has all territories, languages, scripts and currency
  names that can be translated.</p>
  <p>Because these lists are long, it may be more difficult to collect all the
  data at once. If that is the case, we suggest first providing translations of
  at least the elements that are most familiar to people with the target
  language. This might be, for example, the countries, languages, scripts, and
  (modern) currencies for:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Countries having the target language as an official language</li>
    <li>G7 + BRIC countries: US, Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy;
      Brazil, Russia, India, China</li>
    <li>Countries adjacent to the countries in #1</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<blockquote>
  The language codes are based on <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">ISO-639</a>.
  The translations for the names of the other languages in the current given
  language should be cased according to how the language name would appear in
  the middle of a sentence. If the user of this data is going to use the name at
  the beginning of a sentence, the developer (not the translator) will title
  case the word. For example, English will translate fr to be
  &quot;French&quot;, but Spanish will translate fr to be &quot;francés&quot;.
</blockquote>
<h3>Scripts</h3>
<blockquote>
  The script codes are based on <a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/">ISO-15924</a>.
  A script is the set of characters used to display a language. For example,
  English is written with the Latin script, and the ISO-15924 code for Latin is
  &quot;Latn&quot;.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Some language can be written in more than one script. For example, the Serbian
  language can be written in the Latin or Cyrillic scripts, and Uzbek can be
  written with Cyrillic, Latin or Arabic scripts.
</blockquote>
<h3>Territories</h3>
<blockquote>
  The region codes are based on <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/">ISO-3166</a>.
  These region codes include countries, territories and some other places of
  interest around the world.
</blockquote>
<h3>Currencies</h3>
<blockquote>
  The currency codes are based on <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical+Information/Publications/_Publications/tig90.xalter">ISO-4217</a>.
  A similar list can be found <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Portfolio+of+Products+and+Services/Books+Guides/Consumer/th42090.xalter">here</a>.
  There are two things can be translated here. One part is the display currency
  symbol (e.g. the $ for the US dollar), and the other part is the display name
  (e.g. the &quot;US Dollar&quot; for $). The ISO-4217 code is used as the key
  for these translations.
</blockquote>
<h3>Time Zones</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A time zone uses the Olson IDs, such as America/Los Angeles. These IDs
  provide not only the information as to the offset from GMT (UTC), but also the
  daylight savings information. Thus, for example, America/Phoenix is distinct
  from America/Denver because they have different daylight savings time
  behavior. There are many cases where there is no modern difference between two
  IDs; they are only distinguished in the past. For example, America/Chicago and
  America/Indianapolis are currently the same, but differed in the past. For the
  possible timezone IDs that can be translated, see <a href="olson_ids.txt">Olson
  IDs</a>.</p>
  <p>Most countries do not span multiple time zones, and may not have localized
  names for particular time zones. In that case, probably the best localizations
  are something of a form like &quot;New York Time&quot;.</p>
  <p>The fields are long and short (abbreviated) versions of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>generic time zone name, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Time</span></li>
    <li>summer/daylight savings time, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific
      Standard Time</span></li>
    <li>standard time, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Daylight Time</span></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="ExemplarCharacters">Exemplar Characters</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  The exemplar character set contains the commonly used for a given language,
  which can be for testing and for determining the appropriate repertoire of
  characters for charset conversion or collation. It is not a complete set of
  characters for a language, nor should it be considered to apply to multiple
  languages in a particular country. In general, the test to see whether or not
  a character belongs in the set is based on whether it is acceptable in that
  language to always use spellings that avoid that character. For example, the
  exemplar character set for en (English) is the set [a-z]. This set does not
  contain the accented characters that are sometimes seen in words like
  &quot;résumé&quot; or &quot;naïve&quot;, because it is acceptable in common
  practice to spell those words without the accents. The exemplar character set
  for fr (French), on the other hand, must contain those characters.<br>
  <br>
  The exemplar character set for Han characters is composed somewhat
  differently. It is even harder to draw a clear line for Han characters, since
  usage is more more like a frequency curve that slowly trails off to the right
  in terms of decreasing frequency. So for this case, the exemplar characters
  simply contain a set of reasonably frequent characters for the language, based
  on presence in character set standards.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This set is case insensitive. This means it does not need both upper and lower
  case characters. The ordering of these characters are irrelevant. If the sort
  order or collation order is needed, then please refer to the <a href="#Collation">collation
  section</a> of this guide.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="NumberPatterns">Number Patterns</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are different formats for different types of numbers. For example,
  here are some patterns (using the unlocalized symbols) with the corresponding
  text. While the format is localized, the <i>characters to specify the format
  pattern</i> are not localized. That is, the decimal point al</p>
  <p>The <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a> resource affects how these
  patterns are interpreted in a localized context. Here are some examples, based
  on the French locale. The &quot;.&quot; shows where the decimal point should
  go. The &quot;,&quot; shows where the thousands separator should go. A
  &quot;0&quot; indicates zero-padding: if the number is too short, a zero (in
  the locale's numeric set) will go there. A &quot;#&quot; indicates no padding:
  if the number is too short, nothing goes there. A &quot;¤&quot; shows where
  the currency sign will go. The following illustrates the effects of different
  patterns for the French locale, with the number &quot;1234.567&quot;</p>

  <dd>- separates the integer and fractional part of the number.
  <dt><b>group</b>
  <dd>- groups (for example) units of thousands: 10^6 = 1,000,000. The grouping
    separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some countries for
    ten-thousands. The interval is a constant number of digits between the
    grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000. If you supply a
    pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval between the last one

  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount. (If present, the
    value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 123%)
  <dt><b>nativeZeroDigit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that place
    would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0', the pattern
    &quot;000&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as &quot;034&quot;, but the
    pattern &quot;0&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as just &quot;34&quot;. As

    0 value.
  <dt><b>patternDigit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate any digit value, typically #. When that digit is
    zero, then it is not shown.
  <dt><b>minusSign</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.
  <dt><b>plusSign</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.
  <dt><b>exponential</b>
  <dd>- Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.
  <dt><b>perMille</b>

<h3><a name="&lt;localizedPatternChars&gt;">localizedPatternChars</a></h3>
<p>These are characters that can be used when displaying a date pattern to an
end user. This can occur, for example, when a spreadsheet allows users to
specify date patterns. Whatever is in the string is substituted one-for-one with
the characters &quot;<span class="tx">GyMdkHmsSEDFwWahKzYe&quot;, with the above
meanings</span>. Thus, for example, if &quot;J&quot; is to be used instead of
&quot;Y&quot; to mean Year, then the string would be: &quot;<span class="tx">GyMdkHmsSEDFwWahKz<u>J</u>e&quot;.</span></p>
<h3><b>Quoting rules</b></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Single quotes, (<b>'</b>), enclose bits of the pattern that should be
  treated literally. Inside a quoted string, two single quotes ('') are replaced
  with a single one ('). For example: <tt><u>'class of '</u>YYYY<u>' at '</u>h<u>'
  o''clock'</u></tt> -&gt; <b>class of 1939 at 6 o'clock</b> (Literal strings <u>underlined</u>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>AM / PM</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even for countries where the customary date format only has a 24 hour
  format, both the am and pm localized strings must be present and must be
  distinct from one another. Note that as long as the 24 hour format is used,
  these strings will normally never be used, but for testing and unusual
  circumstances they must be present.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Eras</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two values for an era in a Gregorian calendar,
  &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;. These values can be translated into other
  languages, like &quot;a.C.&quot; and and &quot;d.C.&quot; for Spanish, but
  there are no other eras in the Gregorian calendar. Other calendars have a
  different numbers of eras. Care should be taken when translating the era names
  for a specific calendar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Week of Year</h3>
<blockquote>
  Values calculated for the Week of Year field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a
  year is the first week of that year that contains at least the minimum days in
  a week days. Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
  are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed). For example, January
  1, 1998 was a Thursday. If the first day of the week is MONDAY and the minimum
  days in a week is 4 (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many
  national standards), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
  on January 4, 1998. However, if the first day of the week is SUNDAY, then week
  1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and ends on January 10, 1998. The first
  three days of 1998 are then part of week 53 of 1997.
  <p>Values are similarly calculated for the Week of Month.</p>
