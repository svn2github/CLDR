<p align="left">The purpose of the Common Locale Data Repository project is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">devise a general XML format for the exchange of culturally sensitive (locale) information for use in application and system development</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">gather, store, and make available data generated in that format</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">On 2003.07.02, the <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm">specification</a> for the XML format was released. As of 2003.10.31, the Version
1.0 Beta of the locale data was made available for public review and feedback. On 2003.12.19, the Version 1.0 Final Candidate was made available. <i>The CLDR Version 1.0 final
release is pending approval by the OpenI18N steering committee.</i></p>
<p align="left">CLDR 1.0 is just the first step. It provides a version of the data that can be referenced, but enhancements and fixes will come in future versions. We request that
people continue to review the data for languages and countries that they are familiar with for the next version of CLDR, and <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">file bug reports</a>
where they see problems.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Comparison Charts. </b>Perhaps the easiest way to provide feedback is to view the <a href="comparison_charts.html">comparison charts</a>, which provide an HTML
view of data from different sources. There is also locale-insensitive supplementary data which is only available in <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/common/main/supplementalData.xml">XML
format</a>. That data tells which country uses which currency, how many digits each currency takes, and any special rounding behavior.</p>
<p align="left"><b>XML Source. </b>The locale data XML specification and locale data XML files are checked into a <a href>CVS repository</a>, currently hosted on the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/">ICU
site</a>, and available via the web or by using CVS clients. The CVS tag is &quot;release-1-0-alpha&quot;. For information on using CVS clients to access the repository, see <a href="readme.html">readme.html</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The XML source data is organized in the following directories. Within those directories, ignore the folders icu_format/; those are just for production. The xml
files can be divided into main/ and collation/.</p>
