<p align="left"><b><i><font size="5">CLDR 1.0 Available!</font></i></b></p>
<p align="left">On 2003.12.19, the Version 1.0 Final Candidate was made available. This version was approved on 2003.01.16 by the OpenI18N steering committee as CLDR 1.0. This is a
stable release, and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference by other specifications or products. To obtain the data in CLDR 1.0, see <a href="#xml_source">XML
Source</a>.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="project">Project</a>. </b>Briefly, the purpose of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) project is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">devise a general XML format for the exchange of culturally sensitive (locale) information for use in application and system development</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">gather, store, and make available data generated in that format</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">CLDR 1.0 is just the first step. It provides a version of the data that can be referenced, but enhancements and fixes will come in future versions of CLDR. We
request that people continue to review the data for languages and countries that they are familiar with for the next version, and <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">file bug reports</a>
where they see problems. For more details on the CLDR project, see <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/subgroups/lade/locale/index.htm">project description</a>.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a name="xml_source">XML Source</a>. </b>The locale data XML specification and locale data XML files are checked into a <a href>CVS repository</a>, currently
hosted on the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/">ICU site</a>, and available via the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/locale/">web</a> or by using CVS clients.
The CVS tag is &quot;<code>release-1-0-candidate</code>&quot;. For information on using CVS clients to access the repository, see <a href="readme.html">readme.html</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The XML source data is organized in the following directories. Within those directories, ignore the folders icu_format/; those are just for production. The xml
files can be divided into main/ and collation/.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><code>aix/<br>
  common/<br>
  hp/<br>
  ibmjdk/<br>
  icu/<br>
  linux/<br>
  open_office/<br>
  solaris/<br>
  sunjdk/<br>
  windows/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b><i>Note: the data for all but </i><code>common</code><i> is provided for comparison only, and is <u>not</u> to be viewed as authoritative or referenceable.</i></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Known Issues with CLDR 1.0</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The XML and HTML files generated as part of this work appear to stress the common browsers. Most of them will fail on at least some of the XML files, even
    though we have verified the formats with the Xerxes parser. If that happens, try opening with the menu <i>View &gt; Source</i>, or its equivalent.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The generated XML files are not minimal. That is, elements might be repeated that would be inherited from the parent.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The comparison collation data is only generated for a few data sources at present.</li>
</ul>
