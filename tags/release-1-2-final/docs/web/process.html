          <h1>CLDR Technical Committee</h1>
          <h2><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>This document describes the CLDR Technical Committee, and its process for Data 
          Collection, Vetting, Public Feedback and Release. These procedures and process were based 
          on the Unicode Technical Committee Procedures, but are modified to provide for a much 
          lighter-weight process for data collection and release, with a much faster turn-around. In 
          particular, the meetings are much more often, much shorter, and more informal. Most of the 
          work is by email or phone, with a database recording requested changes in data.</p>
          <p>When gathering data for a region and language, it is important to have multiple sources 
          for that data to produce the most widely acceptable data. Initial versions of data will be 
          be based on the best available sources, but the expectation is that CLDR data will be 
          modified and improved, in successive versions, by more input from the contributors inside 
          and outside of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that CLDR is a Repository, not a Registration. That is, 
          contributors should not expect that their contributions will simply be adopted into the 
          repository; instead, it will be vetted against the best available information.</p>
          <p>All inputs will be open, and recorded in a bug/feature request database. Changes in 
          response to items the database may be entered into the repository snapshot over time by 
          the maintainers of the repository, but the final approval of the release of any version of 
          CLDR is up to the decision of the CLDR-TC. For more information, see the
          <a href="procedures.html">CLDR-TC Procedures</a>.</p>
          <h2><a name="data_vetting_process"></a>2. Data Vetting Process</h2>
          <p>Once data for a country and language has been received, the data from the different 
          sources will be compared to show agreements and differences. Initial data contributions 
          are normally marked as &quot;draft&quot;; this will be changed once the data is vetted.</p>
          <p>Note that there are two types of data in the repository:</p>
          <p>a) Comparison data: The contributor can be an individual or an organization. Data from 
          a software platform or product, is normally gathered by calling public APIs, to ensure 
          that the data matches what is actually in use. In either case, the data is only for 
          comparison, and <i>will not be changed</i> except where necessary to update the data to 
          match the external source. The only requirement is that all changed data be versioned, and 
          the Version Numbering Scheme be used.</p>
          <p>b) Common Data: The contents is decided upon by the CLDR-TC, following its procedures 
          and this process.</p>
          <h3>2.1 <a name="resolution_procedure">Resolution Procedure</a></h3>
          <p>Data contributed to CLDR from different sources may be in conflict. For example, a 
          contribution on abbreviated month names may show each abbreviated name ending with a 
          period and another contribution for the same abbreviated month names may not show the 
          trailing period.</p>
          <p>Members are encouraged to use local language and country contacts, inside and outside 
          their organization, to help vet current common data and any new proposals for addition or 
          amendment of common data. In particular, national standards organizations are encouraged 
          to be involved in the data vetting process.</p>
          <p>All people involved in vetting data must be familiar with the
          <a href="data_formats.html">Data Formats</a> and the requirements for
          <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Filing Bug Reports</a>. In particular, they should 
          compare any proposed changes against the data in the <a href="comparison_charts.html">
          Comparison Charts</a> and indicate which platforms the proposed changes align with, or 
          whether they are different than all of the platforms.</p>
          <h3>2.2 <a name="prioritization">Prioritization</a></h3>
          <p>There may be conflicting common practices or standards for a given country and 
          language. Thus LDML provides keyword variants to reflect the different practices. For 
          example, for German it allows the distinction between PHONEBOOK and DICTIONARY collation.</p>
          <p>When there is an existing national standard for a country that is widely accepted in 
          practice, the goal is to follow that standard as much as possible. Where the common 
          practice in the country deviates from the national standard, or if there are multiple 
          conflicting common practices, or options in conforming to the national standard, or 
          conflicting national standards, multiple variants may be entered into the CLDR, 
          distinguished by keyword variants or variant locale identifiers.</p>
          <p>Where a data item is identified as following a particular national standard (or other 
          reference), the goal is to keep that data aligned with that standard. There is, however, 
          no guarantee that data will be tagged with any or all of the national standards that it 
          follows.</p>
          <h3>2.3 <a name="bulk_submissions">Bulk Submissions</a></h3>
          <p>To help our process for bulk submissions of data, such as whole locales or long lists 
          of translated country names, we use the following process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Electronic source documents are required to accompany the bulk submission, for 
            verification (these must be publicly-accessible URLs or scanned pages that we would 
            archive).</li>
            <li>The submission must be in valid LDML format. </li>
            <li>We will then:<ol>
              <li>Check in the data, marked as draft=&#39;true&#39;, with a reference to the given source 
              document.</li>
              <li>If there a previously existing item, it remains, and the new data is also marked 
              with alt=&#39;proposed&#39; (this new attribute will be added to LDML 1.2).</li>
              <li>Send notice to CLDR for review.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>3. <a name="public_feedback">Public Feedback Process</a></h2>
          <p>The public can supply formal feedback into CLDR by filing a
          <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Bug Report or Feature Request (RFE)</a>. Anyone can also 
          asked to be added to a list that will receive notification of new CLDR bugs, so they can 
          track issues if they want. Anyone will also be able to reply to any bug/rfe, to add 
          comments (this latter feature is not yet functional, but will be soon).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To subscribe, send a note to &quot;ecartis+unicode.org&quot; (use an <i>at sign</i> instead of 
            the +) and put &quot;subscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the subject line.</li>
            <li>To unsubscribe, put &quot;unsubscribe cldr-bugrfe&quot; in the&nbsp;subject line instead.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The email archive (in raw form) are in the
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/~ecartis/cldr/">CLDR Email Archives</a>.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/review/">Public Review Issues</a> may be posted in 
          cases where broader public feedback is desired on a particular issue.</p>
          <p>The public is also free to discuss locale issues on the Unicode list
          <a href="mailto:(unicode@unicode.org">unicode@unicode.org</a>, which is devoted to Unicode 
          and related globalization standards (see
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html">Mail Lists</a> to subscribe).</p>
          <p>People should, however, be aware that changes and updates to CLDR will only be taken in 
          response to complete, specific bug reports as described on
          <a href="filing_bug_reports.html">Filing Bug Reports</a>. Discussion on public mailing 
          lists is <i>not</i> monitored; no actions will be taken in response to such discussion -- 
          only in response to filed bugs. The process of checking and entering data takes time and 
          effort; so even when bugs/RFEs are accepted, it may take some time before they are in a 
          release of CLDR.</p>
          <h2><a name="data_release_process"></a>4. Data Release Process</h2>
          <h3>4.1 <a name="version_numbering">Version Numbering</a></h3>
          <p>The locale data is frozen per version. Once a version is released, it is never 
          modified. Any changes, however minor, will mean a newer version of the locale data being 
          released. The versioning scheme is x.y.z, where z is incremented for bug fixes, y is 
          incremented for any additions (such as new locale data or LDML elements), and x is 
          incremented for any major changes in format.</p>
          <h3>4.2 <a name="release_schedule">Release Schedule</a></h3>
          <p>The normal release schedule will involve two releases per year, one on May 15 and one 
          on October 15. Early releases of a version of the common locale data will be issued as 
          either alpha or beta releases, available for public feedback. The dates for the next 
          scheduled release will be on <a href="index.html">CLDR Project</a>.</p>
          <p>The schedule milestones are:</p>

              the current release under development. The only additional bug reports or features 
              that would be accepted into CLDR 1.2 would be reports of problems in incorporating the 
              accepted bug reports / bug fixes. The committee could allow some additional changes, 
              but that would be on an exceptional basis. Bug reports that came in after the freeze 
              would, of course, not be lost: they&#39;d be considered for the next version of CLDR.</td>

          <p>CLDR 1.1 was the first under the sponsorship of the Unicode Consortium, and designed to 
          contain few changes over CLDR 1.0; the goal was to complete the transfer of the project 
          without introducing a large number of changes, so there was limited opportunity for 
          feedback and changes. CLDR 1.2, due in mid-October, will provide more opportunity to 
          incorporate additional data.</p>
          <h2><a name="meetings"></a>Meetings and Communication</h2>
          <p>The currently-scheduled meetings are listed on the
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/timesens/calendar.html">Unicode Calendar</a>. Meetings are 
          held by phone, every week at 8:00 Pacific Time (-08:00 GMT in winter, -07:00 GMT in 
          summer). Some meetings may be skipped if they conflict with holidays or other Unicode 
          meetings.</p>
          <p>There is an internal email list for the Unicode CLDR Technical Committee (CLDR-TC), 
          open to Unicode members and invited experts. All national standards bodies who are

          Unicode Consortium, to gain access to this list.</p>
