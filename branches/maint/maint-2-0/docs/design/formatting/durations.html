<h1>Formatting Durations</h1>
<p>The following is a strawman proposal for additions to CLDR 1.5 to support 
durations. The goal is to have a mechanism that allows for reasonable formatting 
of common durations, with a format which is as easy as possible for translators 
to use (with instruction).</p>
<h2>Formats</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Add a set of flexible formats targeted at durations.<pre><span class="m">&lt;</span><span class="t">durationFormatItem id</span><span class="m">=&quot;</span><b>hhmm</b><span class="m">&quot;&gt;</span>hh:mm:ss<span class="m">&lt;/</span><span class="t">dateFormatItem</span><span class="m">&gt;
&lt;</span><span class="t">durationFormatItem id</span><span class="m">=&quot;</span><b>hhmmss</b><span class="m">&quot;&gt;</span>hh:mm<span class="m">&lt;/</span><span class="t">dateFormatItem</span><span class="m">&gt;
&lt;</span><span class="t">durationFormatItem id</span><span class="m">=&quot;</span><b>hhhmmm</b><span class="m">&quot;&gt;</span>hhh mmm<span class="m">&lt;/</span><span class="t">dateFormatItem</span><span class="m">&gt;
&lt;</span><span class="t">durationFormatItem id</span><span class="m">=&quot;</span><b>wwwddd</b><span class="m">&quot;&gt;</span>ddd www<span class="m">&lt;/</span><span class="t">dateFormatItem</span><span class="m">&gt;</span></pre>
	</li>
	<li>The one and two letter fields have their normal semantics, except that 
	the numeric width of the top field is unbounded. Eg 108 hours and 23.5 
	minutes would be &quot;108:23:30&quot; with the first of the above formats. The 
	difference between hh,HH,kk,KK is ignored: all hour fields are 0..<font face="Times New Roman">&#8734;.</font></li>
	<li>Field values of 3 or above are handled by formatting as special field 
	fields (see below), then substituting. 3 letters (eg hhh) gets the 
	abbreviated format, four letters (like hhhh) gets the wide format.</li>
	<li>There is an additional concatenation format for fallback, eg &quot;{0}, {1}&quot;. 
	If there is no exact match, the longest initial match in big-endian order is 
	used, and the results concatenated with this format. Eg, suppose the key is 
	&quot;dms&quot;, and there is no match. Then we try for &quot;dm&quot;, then &quot;d&quot;, and 
	concatenate that result with the result of formatting the rest, using &quot;{0}, 
	{1}&quot;. So we might get &quot;1 day, 3 minutes 17 seconds&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Special Field Values</h2>
<ol>
	<li>We add structure to CLDR for each field type, something like the following.<pre>&lt;durationLength type=&quot;wide&quot;&gt;
  &lt;duration type=&quot;h&quot; number=&quot;singular&quot;&gt;1 Stunde&lt;/duration&gt;
  &lt;duration type=&quot;h&quot; number=&quot;other&quot;&gt;{0} Stunden&lt;/duration&gt;
  &lt;duration type=&quot;m&quot; number=&quot;singular&quot;&gt;1 Minute&lt;/duration&gt;
  ...
&lt;/durationLength&gt;
&lt;durationLength type=&quot;abbreviated&quot;&gt;
  &lt;duration type=&quot;h&quot; number=&quot;other&quot;&gt;{0}s&lt;/duration&gt;
  &lt;duration type=&quot;m&quot; number=&quot;singular&quot;&gt;1m&lt;/duration&gt;
  ...</pre>
	</li>
	<li>In these fields, {0} is a placeholder that uses the default number 
	format for that locale.</li>
	<li>The <i>number</i> attribute keywords are defined to be the following, 
	initially. (We would add more attributes as we find languages that need them.) 
	So for Russian, what corresponds to the above list would be contain oneMod 
	and fewMod. The <i>other</i> keyword is matched if none of the available 
	others match.<table border="1" id="table1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
		<tr>
			<th>keyword</th>
			<th>tests condition</th>
			<th>comment</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>zero</td>
			<td>x == 0 </td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>one</td>
			<td>x == 1 </td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>two</td>
			<td>x == 2</td>
			<td>used in Slovenian </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>some</td>
			<td>x == 3 || x == 4</td>
			<td>used in Slovenian</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>oneMod</td>
			<td>x == 1 || x &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; (x mod 10) == 1</td>
			<td>used in Russian, Serbian,... </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>fewMod</td>
			<td>2 &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 4 || x &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; 2 &lt;= (x mod 10) &amp;&amp; (x mod 10) &lt;= 4</td>
			<td>used in Russian, Serbian,... </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>other</td>
			<td>x == anything </td>
			<td>only matches if no other conditions true</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</li>
	<li>Issue: should we allow multiple attributes for single element, like 
	&lt;duration type=&quot;h&quot; number=&quot;one some&quot;&gt;{0}zw&lt;/duration&gt;. At this point I don't 
	think it is necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Expected API</h2>
<p>The expected API would have certain parameters.</p>
<ol>
	<li>It would allow the programmer to pass in a key (eg &quot;hm&quot; or &quot;hhhmmm&quot;) as 
	in flexible formats. (While it is possible to pass in fields of mixed 
	lengths, we caution the programmer that it is unlikely that good results 
	will obtain.)</li>
	<li>It would allow the least field to have fractions. The 
	programmer could pass in just the min/max fractional digits (or maybe for 
	generality a number format (for that locale of course)). Thus 108 hours 23.5 
	minutes would be &quot;108:23.5&quot; with the second of the above formats.</li>
	<li>It would allow leading, trailing, and/or interior zero fields (in any 
	combination) to be suppressed. Suppose for example that the key is &quot;dhms&quot;, 
	and the actual value turns out to be 0 days 3 hours 0 minutes 5 seconds. 
	Then here are some results:<ul>
		<li>suppress leading results in &quot;3 hours 0 minutes 5 seconds&quot;</li>
		<li>suppress leading+interior results in &quot;3 hours 5 seconds&quot;</li>
	</ul>The actual key value that is looked up will change if suppression is 
	chosen. So if the key is dhms and the h value is zero, then &quot;dms&quot; is 
	actually looked up in the flexible duration list.</li>
</ol>
