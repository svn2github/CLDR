   for subtags to specify more particular behavior or refinements that
   are language and/or locale based according to work done by the
   Unicode Consortium.

1.  Introduction

   BCP 47 explicitly provides for the ability to define single-letter
   extension subtags to provide for "the generation of identifiers that
   contain a language component and are compatible with applications
   that understand language tags".  This extension provides such an
   extension, using the letter 'u', to specify Unicode language/locale
   identifiers.  See RFC 4646.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  BCP47 Required Information

   The maintaining authority for this registry is the Unicode
   Consortium.

   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+

   The specification of extension subtags is provided by "Unicode
   Technical Standard #35 Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML),
   Section 3.2 BCP 47 Tag Conversion" is hereafter known as "LDML".
   LDML and all subtags defined by LDML follow the BCP 47 language tag
   ABNF and other rules for the formation of tags and subtags as defined
   in BCP 47.  In particular, it specifies that case is not significant
   and no subtags exceed eight characters in length.

   LDML specifies a canonical representation.  LDML is available over
   the Internet and at no cost, and is available via a royalty-free
   license at http://unicode.org/copyright.html.  The LDML is versioned,
   and each version of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable.  Extension
   subtags, once defined by LDML, are never retracted or change in

   meaning in any substantial way.  The specification will include in a
   separate section the registration form reproduced in this section
   (below) to be used in registering the extension upon publication as
   an RFC.

2.1.  Summary

   LDML defines the subtags within the 'u' extension as a series of key-
   value pairs.  Each key is of length 2, and each value is of length 3
   or more.  Each key is followed by zero or one value.  Case is not
   significant.  The canonical case is lowercase; the canonical order of
   the keys is alphabetical.

   The exact keys and values available, and their meanings, are defined
   in LDML, or in referenced data tables.
