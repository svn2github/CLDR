      <t>This document specifies the 'u' extension to BCP 47

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>BCP 47 explicitly provides for the ability to define single-letter
      extension subtags to provide for "the generation of identifiers that
      contain a language component and are compatible with applications that
      understand language tags". This extension provides such an extension,
      using the letter 'u', to specify Unicode language/locale identifiers.
      See RFC 4646.</t>

        <c>Specification</c>

        <c>Unicode Technical Standard #35 Unicode Locale Data Markup Language
        (LDML), http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/</c>

        <c>Section</c>

        <c>Section 3.2 BCP 47 Tag Conversion</c>
      </texttable>

      <t>The specification of extension subtags is provided by "Unicode
      Technical Standard #35 Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML),
      Section 3.2 BCP 47 Tag Conversion" is hereafter known as "LDML". LDML
      and all subtags defined by LDML follow the BCP 47 language tag ABNF and
      other rules for the formation of tags and subtags as defined in BCP 47.
      In particular, it specifies that case is not significant and no subtags
      exceed eight characters in length.</t>
      <t>LDML specifies a canonical
      representation. LDML is available over the Internet and at no cost, and
      is available via a royalty-free license at
      http://unicode.org/copyright.html. The LDML is versioned, and each
      version of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable. Extension subtags, once
      defined by LDML, are never retracted or change in meaning in any
      substantial way. The specification will include in a separate section
      the registration form reproduced in this section (below) to be used in
      registering the extension upon publication as an RFC.</t>

      <section title="Summary">
        <t>LDML defines the subtags within the 'u' extension as a series of
        key-value pairs. Each key is of length 2, and each value is of length
        3 or more. Each key is followed by zero or one value. Case is not
        significant. The canonical case is lowercase; the canonical order of
        the keys is alphabetical.</t>

        <t>The exact keys and values available, and their meanings, are
        defined in LDML, or in referenced data tables.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
