				<xref target="BCP47"></xref>
				permits the definition and registration of language tag extensions
				"that contain a language component and are compatible with
				applications that
				understand language tags". This document defines an
				extension for
				specifying the source of a text transformation,
				including text that has been transliterated, transcribed, or
				translated.
				The "singleton" identifier for this extension is 't'.
			</t>
			<t>
				Language tags, as defined by
				<xref target="BCP47"></xref>, are useful for identifying the language of content.
				There are
				mechanisms for specifying variant subtags for special purposes.
				However, these variants are insufficient for specifying text
				transformations,
				including text that has been
				transliterated,
				transcribed, or
				translated.
				That
				is, for fully
				specifying such text, it
				is important to specify the
				source language
				and/or script.
				In addition,
				it may also be important
				to identify a
				particular
				specification for the
				transformation.
			</t>
			<t>
				For example, if one is transcribing the names of Italian or
				Russian
				cities on a map for
				Japanese users, each name will need to be
				transliterated into katakana using
				rules
				appropriate for the specific
				source and target language.
				When tagging such data, it is important
				to be able to indicate not only
				the resulting content
				language ("ja"
				in this case), but also the source language.</t>
			<t>Transforms such as transliteration may vary depending not only on
				the basis of
				the source and target script, but also language.
				Thus the
				Russian &lt;U+041F U+0443 U+0442 U+0438 U+043D> (which
				corresponds to
				the Cyrillic &lt;PE, U, TE, I, EN>) transliterates
				into "Putin" in
				English but "Poutine" in French.
				The identifier may
				need to indicate a
				desired mechanical transformation
				in an API, or
				may need to tag data
				that has been converted
				(mechanically or by
				hand) according to a
				transliteration method.</t>

		<section title="BCP47 Required Information">
            <section title="Introduction">
				<t>
					Identification of transforms can be done using the 't' extension
					defined in this document.
					This extension is formed by the 't'
					singleton followed by a sequence of subtags that would form a
					language tag defined by
					<xref target="BCP47"></xref>.
					This allows for the source language or script to be specified to
					the degree of precision required.
					There are restrictions on the
					sequence of subtags.
					They MUST form a regular, valid, canonical
					language
					tag, and MUST neither include extensions nor private use
					sequences introduced by the
					singleton
					'x'.
					Where only the script is
					relevant (such as identifying
					a
					script-script
					transliteration) then
					'und' is used for the primary language subtag.
				</t>
				<t>For example:</t>
				<texttable>
					<ttcol>Language Tag</ttcol>
	
					<ttcol>Description</ttcol>
	
					<c>ja-t-it</c>
	
					<c>The content is Japanese, transformed from Italian.</c>
	
					<c>ja-Kana-t-it</c>
	
					<c>The content is Japanese Katakana, transformed from Italian.</c>
	
					<c>und-Latn-t-und-cyrl</c>
	
					<c>The content is in the Latin script, transformed from the Cyrillic
						script.</c>
	
				</texttable>
				<t>
					Note that the sequence of subtags governed by 't' cannot contain a
					singleton (a single-character subtag), because that would start a
					new extension.
					For example, the tag "ja-t-i-ami"
					does not indicate
					that the source is in "i-ami", because "i-ami" is not a
					regular
					language tag in
					<xref target="BCP47"></xref>. That tag would express an empty 't' extension followed by an 'i'
					extension.
				</t>
				<t>In addition, it is sometimes necessary to indicate additional
					information about the transformation.
					This additional information is optionally supplied after the source in a series of one or more fields,
					where each field consists of a field separator subtag followed by one or more non-separator subtags.
					Each field separator subtag consists of a single letter followed by a single digit.
					</t>
				<t>A transformation mechanism is an optional field that indicates
					the
					specification used for the transformation, such as "UNGEGN" for
					the
					the United Nations Group of Experts on
					Geographical
					Names
					transliterations and transcriptions. It uses the 'm0' field separator followed by certain subtags.
				</t>
				<t>For example:</t>
				<texttable>
					<ttcol>Language Tag</ttcol>
	
					<ttcol>Description</ttcol>
	
					<c>und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-2007</c>
	
					<c>the content is in Cyrillic, transformed from Latn, according
						to a
						UNGEGN specification dated 2007.</c>
	
				</texttable>
				<t>The field separator subtags such as 'm0' were chosen because they are
					short, visually distinctive,
					and cannot occur in a language subtag
					(outside of an extension and
					after 'x'),
					thus eliminating the
					potential for collision or confusion with the
					source language tag.</t>
				<t>
					The field subtags are defined by
					<eref target="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/">Section 3</eref>
					of
					<xref target="UTS35">Unicode
						Technical Standard #35: Unicode Locale Data
						Markup Language</xref>. As required by BCP 47, subtags follow the language tag ABNF and
					other rules for the formation of language tags and subtags, are
					restricted to the ASCII letters and digits, are not case sensitive,
					and do not exceed eight characters in length.
				</t>
				<t>
					EDITORIAL NOTE: This new facility has been accepted by the Unicode
					CLDR
					committee for incorporation into the next version of Unicode
					CLDR, parallel
					with the structure of the 'u' extension
					<xref target="RFC6067"></xref>,
					for which it is already the maintaining authority.
					The data and
					specification will be available by the time this internet
					draft has
					been
					approved.

				<t>One field is initially specified in
					<xref target="UTS35"></xref>: the transform mechanism. That field is summarized here:
					<list style="letters">
						<t>
							The transform mechanism consists of a sequence of
							subtags
							starting
							with the 'm0' separator followed by one or more
							mechanism subtags.
							Each mechanism subtag has a length of 3 to 8
							alphanumeric
							characters.
							The sequence as a whole provides an
							identification of the
							specification
							for the transform,
							such as the
							mechanism subtag 'UNGEGN' in
							"und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn".
							In
							many cases, only one mechanism subtag is necessary, but
							multiple
							subtags MAY be defined in
							<xref target="UTS35"></xref>
							where necessary.
						</t>
						<t>
							Any purely numeric subtag is a representation of a date in the
							Gregorian calendar.
							It MAY occur in any mechanism field.
							If it
							does occur:
							<list style="symbols">
								<t>it MUST occur as the final subtag in the field,</t>
								<t>it MUST NOT be the only subtag in the field, and</t>
								<t>it MUST consist of a sequence of digits of the form YYYY,
									YYYYMM, or YYYYMMDD.</t>
							</list>
							For example, 20110623
							represents June 23th, 2011.
							A date subtag
							SHOULD only be used where necessary, and then
							SHOULD be as short
							as possible.
							For example, suppose that the BGN transliteration
							specification for Cyrillic to Latin had three versions,
							dated
							June 11th, 1999; Dec 30th, 1999; and May 1st, 2011.
							In that
							case, the corresponding first two DATE subtags would require
							months
							to be distinctive (199906 and 199912), but the last
							subtag
							would only
							require the year (2011).
						</t>
						<t>
							Some mechanisms may use a versioning system that is not
							distinguished by date, or not by date alone.
							In the latter case,
							the version will be of a form specified by
							<xref target="UTS35"></xref>
							for that mechanism.
							For example, if the mechanism XXX uses
							versions of the form v21a,
							then a tag could look like
							"ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a". If there are
							multiple subversions
							distinguished by date,
							then a tag could look like
							"ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a-2007".

					Each release has an associated data directory of the form
					"http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/&lt;version&gt;", where

					for version 1.7.2, the "core.zip" file is located at
					<eref target="http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.2/">http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.2/core.zip</eref>.

				This document will require IANA to insert the record in

				into the Language Extensions Registry, according to
				Section 3.7.
				Extensions and the Extensions Registry of "Tags for
				Identifying
				Languages" in
				<xref target="BCP47"></xref>. Per Section 5.2 of
				<xref target="BCP47"></xref>, there might be occasional (rare) requests by the Unicode
				Consortium (the "Authority" listed in the record) for maintenance of
				this record. Changes that can be submitted to IANA without the
				publication of a new RFC are limited to modification of the
				Comments, Contact_Email, Mailing_List, and URL fields. Any such
				requested changes MUST use the domain 'unicode.org' in any new
				addresses or URIs, MUST explicitly cite this document (so that IANA
				can reference these requirements), and MUST originate from the
				'unicode.org' domain. The domain or authority can only be changed
				via a new RFC.

			<t>This document does not require IANA to create or maintain a new
				registry or otherwise impact IANA.</t>
